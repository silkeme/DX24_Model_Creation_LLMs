Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the instructions given, here is the table identifying the sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                 |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                  |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                 |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is identified by its type (Flow Indicator or Level Indicator) and its placement in the system, which corresponds to the elements it is connected to or the tank it is associated with.
