Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                 |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                  |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                 |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is placed according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is only one sensor of each type and number combination in the image.
