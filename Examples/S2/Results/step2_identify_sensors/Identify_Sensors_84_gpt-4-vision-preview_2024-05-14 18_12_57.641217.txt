Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                   |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3   |

Each sensor is identified by its tag number (e.g., FI 1, LI 2, etc.), and the type of sensor is determined by the symbol (FI for Flow Indicator, LI for Level Indicator). The placement of each sensor is described by the elements it is connected to or the tank it is associated with. The flow indicators are placed above the pipes, and the level indicators are on the right side of the tanks, as per the instructions.
