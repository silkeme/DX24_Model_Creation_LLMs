Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type  | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Between Inlet and pump |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| At tank1              |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| Between tank1 and valveLinear1 |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| At tank              |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| Between pump1 and valveLinear2 |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| At tank2              |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| Between valveLinear3 and Outlet2 |

Each sensor type and number corresponds to the correct placement on the P&ID as per the rules provided.
