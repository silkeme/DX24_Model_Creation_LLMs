Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                   |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to Outlet2 |

Each sensor is correctly placed according to the rules: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is no sensor below any pipe, and each sensor number corresponds to only one sensor in the diagram.
