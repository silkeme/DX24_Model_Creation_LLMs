Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type  | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                 |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                  |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                 |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is identified by its tag number (e.g., FI 1, LI 2, etc.), and the type of sensor is indicated by the letters (FI for Flow Indicator, LI for Level Indicator). The sensor placement column describes where the sensor is located in the system, either by the elements it is connected to (for flow indicators) or by the element it is attached to (for level indicators).
