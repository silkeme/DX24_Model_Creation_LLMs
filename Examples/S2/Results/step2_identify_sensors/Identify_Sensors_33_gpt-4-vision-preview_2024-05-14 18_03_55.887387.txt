Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the instructions given, here is the table identifying the sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                 |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                  |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                 |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is placed according to the rules: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements.
