Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                   |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3   |

Each sensor type and number corresponds to the placement indicated in the P&ID, with level indicators (LI) positioned on the right side of the tanks and flow indicators (FI) positioned above the pipes connecting the elements as specified.
