Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator | Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                   |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator | tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                    |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator | pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                   |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to Outlet2 |

Each sensor is correctly placed according to the rules: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting the elements.
