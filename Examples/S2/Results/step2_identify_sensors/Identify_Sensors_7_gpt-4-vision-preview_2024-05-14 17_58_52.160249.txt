Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator | Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                   |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator | tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                    |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator | pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                   |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator | tank2 to valveLinear3   |

Each sensor is identified by its tag number (e.g., FI 1, LI 2, etc.), and the type of sensor is determined by the symbol on the diagram (FI for Flow Indicator, LI for Level Indicator). The placement is described by the elements the sensor is connected to or the tank it is associated with. The level indicators (LI) are placed on the right side of the tanks as specified, and the flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes connecting the elements.
