Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator | Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator | tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                   |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator | pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator | tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is identified by its unique number and type (FI for Flow Indicator and LI for Level Indicator). The placement is determined by the location of the sensor in the diagram, with level indicators being on the right side of the tanks and flow indicators being above the pipes connecting two elements.
