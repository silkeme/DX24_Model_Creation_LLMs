Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type  | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Between Inlet and pump |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| At tank1              |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| Between tank1 and valveLinear1 |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| At tank              |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| Between pump1 and valveLinear2 |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| At tank2              |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| Between tank2 and valveLinear3 |

Each sensor type and number combination occurs only once in the image, and the placement of each sensor corresponds to the elements it is connected to, as per the instructions provided.
