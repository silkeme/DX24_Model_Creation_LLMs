Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump           |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1   |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                   |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2   |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3   |

Each sensor is identified by its label (e.g., FI for Flow Indicator, LI for Level Indicator) and its number. The placement is determined by the location of the sensor in the diagram: level indicators are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators are above the pipes connecting two elements.
