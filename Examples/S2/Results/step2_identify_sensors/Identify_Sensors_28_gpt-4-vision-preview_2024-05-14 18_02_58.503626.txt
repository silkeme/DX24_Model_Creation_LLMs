Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type  | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump         |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1 |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                 |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2 |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3 |

Each sensor is identified by its tag number (e.g., FI 1, LI 2, etc.), which corresponds to the type of sensor (Flow Indicator or Level Indicator) and its placement in the system. The placement is determined by the elements the sensor is connected to or the element it is monitoring.
