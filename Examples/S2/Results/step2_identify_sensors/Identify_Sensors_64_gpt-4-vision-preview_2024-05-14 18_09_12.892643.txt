Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type  | Sensor Placement       |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow Indicator| Inlet to pump          |
| LI 2        | Level Indicator| tank1                 |
| FI 3        | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear1  |
| LI 4        | Level Indicator| tank                  |
| FI 5        | Flow Indicator| pump1 to valveLinear2  |
| LI 6        | Level Indicator| tank2                 |
| FI 7        | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear3  |

Each sensor is identified by its tag number (e.g., FI 1, LI 2, etc.), and the type of sensor is indicated (Flow Indicator or Level Indicator). The sensor placement is described by the elements the sensor is connected to or the element it is measuring. For level indicators, the placement is simply the tank they are associated with, while for flow indicators, the placement is between the two elements the flow is being measured through.
