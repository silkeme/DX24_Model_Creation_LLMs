Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on incompressible fluid assumption
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations based on linear valve characteristics and no energy losses
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank water level as a function of volume
tank1_level = tank1_m / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * tank1_Height)
tank_level = tank_m / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * tank_Height)
tank2_level = tank2_m / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * tank2_Height)
```

Now, we will store all the variables used in the equations in one list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    tank1_level, tank_level, tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter,
    tank1_Height, tank_Height, tank2_Height,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_m, tank_m, tank2_m,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```
