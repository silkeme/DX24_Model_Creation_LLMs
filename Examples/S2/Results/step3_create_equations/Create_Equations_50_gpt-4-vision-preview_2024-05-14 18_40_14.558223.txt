Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `tank_level`, `tank1_level`, `tank2_level`: Water levels in the tanks
- `der_tank_level`, `der_tank1_level`, `der_tank2_level`: Time derivatives of the water levels in the tanks
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`, `valveLinear2_V_flow`, `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flows through the valves
- `pump_N`, `pump1_N`: Rotational speeds of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, `valveLinear3_opening`: Openings of the valves
- `pump_N_Nominal`, `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal rotational speeds of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flows of the valves
- `tank_Diameter`, `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`: Diameters of the tanks
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Volume of the pumps

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the flow into the tank equals the flow out of the tank minus the flow through the valve, and that the tanks are cylindrical (hence the area calculation using the diameter). The valve flow is assumed to be proportional to the valve opening times its nominal flow. The pump flow is assumed to be proportional to the pump speed times its volume. The list of variables includes all the variables that appear in the equations.
