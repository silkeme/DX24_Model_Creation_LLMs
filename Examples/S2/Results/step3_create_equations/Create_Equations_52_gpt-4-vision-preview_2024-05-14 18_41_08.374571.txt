Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `tank_level`, `tank1_level`, `tank2_level`: Water levels in the tanks
- `der_tank_level`, `der_tank1_level`, `der_tank2_level`: Time derivatives of the water levels in the tanks
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`, `valveLinear2_V_flow`, `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flows through the valves
- `pump_N`, `pump1_N`: Speed of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, `valveLinear3_opening`: Openings of the valves
- `pump_N_Nominal`, `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speeds of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flows of the valves
- `tank_Diameter`, `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`: Diameters of the tanks
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Volume of the pumps

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the fluid is incompressible, there are no energy losses, the process is adiabatic, and the tanks are open. The actual flow rates through the pumps and valves depend on the control variables `pump_N`, `pump1_N`, and the valve openings. The water levels in the tanks are calculated based on the difference between inflow and outflow, divided by the cross-sectional area of the tanks.
