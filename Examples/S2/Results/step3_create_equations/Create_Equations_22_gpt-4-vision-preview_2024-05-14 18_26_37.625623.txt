Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create a set of equations to model the dynamics of the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the top of the tanks is atmospheric pressure.

Let's define the equations for the pumps, valves, and tanks:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Tank outflow dynamics
tank1_outflow = valveLinear1_flow
tank2_outflow = valveLinear3_flow
tank_outflow = pump1_flow
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_N, pump1_N, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_flow, pump1_flow, valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level, tank1_outflow, tank2_outflow, tank_outflow,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter, pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, the volume flow through each valve and pump, and the derivatives of the levels of the tanks. The parameters and control variables are also included as they are used in the equations.
