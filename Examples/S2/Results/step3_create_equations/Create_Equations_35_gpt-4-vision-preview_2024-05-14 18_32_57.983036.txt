Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create a set of equations to model the dynamics of the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere.

Let's define the equations for the pumps, tanks, and valves:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_m_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_m_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_m_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations (linear valve model)
valveLinear1_m_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal) ** 2) ** 0.5
valveLinear2_m_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal) ** 2) ** 0.5
valveLinear3_m_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal) ** 2) ** 0.5

# Outlet flow equations
outlet1_flow = valveLinear2_m_flow
outlet2_flow = valveLinear3_m_flow
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_m_flow, valveLinear2_m_flow, valveLinear3_m_flow,
    outlet1_flow, outlet2_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations, as well as the control variables and parameters that define the system's behavior. The equations describe the flow through the pumps and valves and the dynamics of the water level in the tanks.
