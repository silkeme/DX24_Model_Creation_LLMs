Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pumps and valves and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

First, let's define the equations for the pumps, valves, and tanks:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the flow rates through the pumps and valves, the derivatives of the tank levels, the control variables for the pumps and valves, the nominal pump speeds, and the nominal flow rates for the valves, as well as the diameters of the tanks.

Please note that the equations above are simplified and assume that the flow rates are directly proportional to the pump speeds and valve openings. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as pump and valve characteristics, fluid dynamics, and system resistance would need to be considered.
