Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow rate through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`, `pump1_N`: Control variable for the speed of the pumps
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Volume per revolution for the pumps
- `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, `valveLinear3_opening`: Control variable for the opening of the valves
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate for the valves
- `tank1_Diameter`, `tank_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of the tanks

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the fluid is incompressible, there are no energy losses, the process is adiabatic, and the tanks are open. The actual flow rates through the pumps and valves depend on the control variables `pump_N`, `pump1_N`, `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, and `valveLinear3_opening`. The rate of change of water level in the tanks is derived from the conservation of mass, considering the cross-sectional area of the tanks and the flow rates in and out.
