Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `tank_level`: Water level in tank
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `tank2_level`: Water level in tank2
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Rotational speed of the pump
- `pump_V`: Displacement volume of the pump

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the fluid is incompressible, there are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic. The tanks are open, which means the pressure at the surface of the fluid in the tanks is atmospheric and does not affect the flow equations.
