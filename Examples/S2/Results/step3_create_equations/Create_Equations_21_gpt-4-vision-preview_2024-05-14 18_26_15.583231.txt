Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow rate through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear3
- `tank1_level`, `tank2_level`, `tank_level`: Water level in the respective tanks
- `pump_N`, `pump1_N`: Speed of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of the valves (0-1)
- `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`, `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of the tanks
- `pump_N_Nominal`, `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of the valves
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Volume of the pumps

Note: The equations assume that the flow rates are directly proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tanks have a cylindrical shape for the calculation of the water level change rate. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, and there are no energy losses or heat transfer, as the process is adiabatic and the tanks are open.
