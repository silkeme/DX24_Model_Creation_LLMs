Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, we will store all the variables in a list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Rotational speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Rotational speed of pump1
- `pump_V`: Volume per rotation of the pump
- `pump1_V`: Volume per rotation of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2

Please note that the actual values for the parameters like `pump_V`, `pump1_V`, `tank1_Diameter`, `tank_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`, `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, and `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal` need to be provided to solve the equations. The equations assume a simple linear relationship between valve opening and flow, which may not be accurate for real valves. More complex valve characteristics can be incorporated if needed.
