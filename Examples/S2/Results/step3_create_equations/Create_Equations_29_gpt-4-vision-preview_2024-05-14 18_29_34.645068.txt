Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for pumps and valves and a simple mass balance for the tanks. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (œÅ) and use the cross-sectional area (A) of the tanks to relate the volume flow rate (Q) to the change in water level (h).

Here are the equations for the system:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_Q = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
der_pump_medium_h = pump_Q / (3.14159265359 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Tank1 equations
tank1_Q_in = pump_Q
tank1_Q_out = valveLinear1_V_flow
der_tank1_level = (tank1_Q_in - tank1_Q_out) / (3.14159265359 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# ValveLinear1 equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank equations
tank_Q_in = valveLinear1_V_flow
tank_Q_out = pump1_V_flow
der_tank_level = (tank_Q_in - tank_Q_out) / (3.14159265359 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Pump1 equations
pump1_Q = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V
der_pump1_medium_h = pump1_Q / (3.14159265359 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# ValveLinear2 equations
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal

# Tank2 equations
tank2_Q_in = pump_Q
tank2_Q_out = valveLinear3_V_flow
der_tank2_level = (tank2_Q_in - tank2_Q_out) / (3.14159265359 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# ValveLinear3 equations
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_Q, der_pump_medium_h, tank1_Q_in, tank1_Q_out, der_tank1_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, tank_Q_in, tank_Q_out, der_tank_level, pump1_Q,
    der_pump1_medium_h, valveLinear2_V_flow, tank2_Q_in, tank2_Q_out,
    der_tank2_level, valveLinear3_V_flow
]
```

This list includes the flow rates through each pump and valve, as well as the derivatives of the medium height in the pumps and the water level in each tank. The variables starting with 'der' represent the time derivatives of the corresponding state variables.
