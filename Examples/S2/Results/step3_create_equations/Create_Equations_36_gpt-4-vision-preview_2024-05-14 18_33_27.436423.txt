Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create a set of equations to model the dynamics of the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the water surface is constant.

Let's define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tanks:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Equations for water level in tanks
tank1_level = der_tank1_level * time
tank2_level = der_tank2_level * time
tank_level = der_tank_level * time
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_flow, pump1_flow, der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow, tank1_level,
    tank2_level, tank_level, pump_N, pump1_N, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening, pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter, pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list includes the variables as they occur in the equations, the variable list, and the parameter list. The equations provided are in plain Python and are based on the assumptions and information given. The variables starting with 'der' represent the derivatives of the respective quantities with respect to time.
