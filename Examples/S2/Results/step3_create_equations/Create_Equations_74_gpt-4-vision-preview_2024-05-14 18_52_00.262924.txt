Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create a set of equations to model the dynamics of the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere.

Let's define the equations for the pumps, valves, and tanks:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the flow rates through the pumps and valves, the derivatives of the tank levels, the control variables for the pumps and valves, the nominal pump speeds, the nominal flow rates for the valves, and the volumes of the pumps, as well as the diameters of the tanks.
