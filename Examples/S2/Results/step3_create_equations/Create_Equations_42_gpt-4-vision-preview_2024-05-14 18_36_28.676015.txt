Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`, `tank_Diameter`: Diameters of the tanks
- `pump_N_Nominal`, `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speeds of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flows of the valves
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Volume of the pumps

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the fluid is incompressible, there are no energy losses, the process is adiabatic, and the tanks are open. The actual flow through the valves and pumps will depend on the system's dynamics and the control variables' settings.
