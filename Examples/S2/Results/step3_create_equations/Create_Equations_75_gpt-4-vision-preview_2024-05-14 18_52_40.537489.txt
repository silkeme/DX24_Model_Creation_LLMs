The equations assume that the flow into the tanks is equal to the flow from the pump minus the flow through the valves, and the flow out of the tanks is equal to the flow through the valves minus the flow from the subsequent pump. The volume flow through each valve is assumed to be proportional to its opening fraction times its nominal flow rate. The volume flow through each pump is assumed to be proportional to its rotational speed times its displacement volume. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is calculated by dividing the net flow into the tank by the cross-sectional area of the tank.
