Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the water surface is constant and equal to atmospheric pressure.

Let's define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tanks.

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)
