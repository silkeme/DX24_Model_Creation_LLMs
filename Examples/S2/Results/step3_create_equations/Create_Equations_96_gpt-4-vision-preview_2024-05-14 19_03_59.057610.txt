Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on incompressible fluid assumption
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations based on linear valve assumption
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Outlet flow equations
# Assuming outlet flow is equal to the flow through the valve leading to it
outlet1_flow = valveLinear2_V_flow
outlet2_flow = valveLinear3_V_flow
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    outlet1_flow, outlet2_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the derivatives of the tank levels, the flow through each pump and valve, and the outlet flows. It also includes the control variables for the pumps and valves, as well as the parameters for the pump volumes and tank diameters.
