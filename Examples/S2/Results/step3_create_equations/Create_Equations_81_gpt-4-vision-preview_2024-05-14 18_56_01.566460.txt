Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the pumps and valves, and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

Here are the equations for the system:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Tank outflow equations
tank1_outflow = valveLinear1_flow
tank_outflow = pump1_flow
tank2_outflow = valveLinear3_flow
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    tank1_outflow, tank_outflow, tank2_outflow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter,
    pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list includes the variables for the flow rates through the pumps and valves, the derivatives of the tank levels (which represent the rate of change of the water level in each tank), and the outflow from each tank. The control variables for the pump speeds and valve openings are also included, as well as the nominal flow rates and diameters from the parameters.
