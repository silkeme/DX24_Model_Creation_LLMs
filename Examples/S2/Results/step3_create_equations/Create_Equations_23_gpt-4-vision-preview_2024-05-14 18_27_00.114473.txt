Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pumps and valves and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

First, let's define the equations for the pumps, valves, and tanks:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the flow through each pump and valve, the rate of change of the water level in each tank, the control variables for the pumps and valves, the nominal pump speeds, the nominal flow rates for the valves, and the volumes of the pumps, as well as the diameters of the tanks.

Please note that the equations above are not complete Python code and are meant to represent the mathematical relationships between the variables. The actual implementation would require additional code to define the variables and parameters, as well as to integrate the differential equations over time to simulate the system's behavior.
