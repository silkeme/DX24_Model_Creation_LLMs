Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Rotational speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Rotational speed of pump1
- `pump_V`: Volume per rotation of the pump
- `pump1_V`: Volume per rotation of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear3
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank

The equations assume that the flow into the tank equals the flow out of the tank minus the flow through the valve, and the change in water level is the net flow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The flow through each valve is assumed to be proportional to its opening fraction times its nominal flow rate. The volume flow through each pump is assumed to be the product of its rotational speed and volume per rotation.
