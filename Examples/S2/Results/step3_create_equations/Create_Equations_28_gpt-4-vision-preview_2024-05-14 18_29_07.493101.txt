Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow rate through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Rotational speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Rotational speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `tank_Diameter`, `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`: Diameters of the tanks
- `pump_V`, `pump1_V`: Displacement volume of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rates of the valves

The equations assume that the flow into the tanks is equal to the flow from the pumps minus the flow through the valves. The flow through the valves is assumed to be proportional to their opening fraction times their nominal flow rate. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is calculated by dividing the net flow rate by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The cross-sectional area is calculated using the diameter of the tank and assuming a circular cross-section.
