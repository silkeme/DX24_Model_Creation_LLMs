Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on incompressible fluid assumption
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations based on linear valve characteristics and no energy losses
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Outlet flow equations
outlet1_flow = valveLinear2_V_flow
outlet2_flow = valveLinear3_V_flow
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    outlet1_flow, outlet2_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Please note that the actual Python code would require the definition of the symbols and parameters, as well as the implementation of numerical solvers to simulate the system dynamics over time.
