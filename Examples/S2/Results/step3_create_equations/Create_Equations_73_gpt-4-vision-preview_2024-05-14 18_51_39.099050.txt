Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level dynamics (assuming cross-sectional area A = Ï€ * D^2 / 4 for a cylindrical tank)
tank1_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * tank1_Diameter**2 / 4
tank_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * tank_Diameter**2 / 4
tank2_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * tank2_Diameter**2 / 4

der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / tank_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area

# Valve flow equations (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, we will store all the variables in one list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank_cross_sectional_area, tank2_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list contains the variables used in the equations, which represent the flow through the pumps and valves, as well as the rate of change of the water level in each tank. The parameters for the diameters of the tanks and the nominal flow rates and openings of the valves are also included, as they are necessary for calculating the flows and levels.
