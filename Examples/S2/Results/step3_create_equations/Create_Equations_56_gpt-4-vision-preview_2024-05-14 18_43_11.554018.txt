Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on incompressible fluid assumption
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations based on linear valve characteristics and no energy losses
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Update tank levels
tank1_level += der_tank1_level * time
tank_level += der_tank_level * time
tank2_level += der_tank2_level * time
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_N, pump_V, pump1_N, pump1_V, pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank1_level, tank_level, tank2_level,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes all the variables that appear in the equations, as well as the derivatives of the tank levels, which are used to update the tank levels over time. The variables `pump_flow` and `pump1_flow` represent the volumetric flow rates through the pumps, which are calculated based on the pump speed (`pump_N` and `pump1_N`) and the pump volume per revolution (`pump_V` and `pump1_V`). The variables `valveLinear1_V_flow`, `valveLinear2_V_flow`, and `valveLinear3_V_flow` represent the volumetric flow rates through the valves, which are calculated based on the valve openings and nominal flow rates. The derivatives `der_tank1_level`, `der_tank_level`, and `der_tank2_level` represent the rates of change of the water levels in the tanks.
