Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `tank1_level`, `tank2_level`, `tank_level`: Water level in the respective tanks
- `pump_N`, `pump1_N`: Speed of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_opening`, `valveLinear2_opening`, `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of the valves (0-1)
- `pump_N_Nominal`, `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pumps
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through the valves
- `tank1_Diameter`, `tank2_Diameter`, `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of the tanks

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the flow into the tanks is equal to the flow out of the pumps and that the flow out of the tanks is equal to the flow through the valves. The rate of change of the water level in the tanks is calculated by dividing the net flow rate by the cross-sectional area of the tanks. The volume flow through the valves is assumed to be proportional to their opening fraction and their nominal flow rate.
