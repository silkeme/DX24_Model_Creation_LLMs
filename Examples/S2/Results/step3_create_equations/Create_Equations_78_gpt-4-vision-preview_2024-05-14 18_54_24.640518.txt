Based on the provided table and the image of the system, we can create a set of equations to describe the dynamics of the fluid flow and the level in each tank. We will use the given variable, parameter, and control variable names.

First, let's define the equations for the pumps and valves, assuming a linear relationship between the control variable (e.g., pump speed or valve opening) and the flow rate. We will also define the equations for the tank levels based on the inflow and outflow rates.

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

Please note that the above equations and variable list are based on the assumptions provided and the names given. The actual dynamics of the system could be more complex, and additional factors such as pump and valve characteristics, fluid properties, and system geometry would need to be considered for a more accurate model.
