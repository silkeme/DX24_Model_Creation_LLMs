Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the derivatives of the tank levels, the volume flows through the pumps and valves, the control variables for the pumps and valves, and the parameters for the tank diameters. The equations assume that the flow into the tank is equal to the pump flow minus the flow through the valve, and the change in tank level is the net flow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The valve flow is assumed to be proportional to the valve opening times its nominal flow rate.
