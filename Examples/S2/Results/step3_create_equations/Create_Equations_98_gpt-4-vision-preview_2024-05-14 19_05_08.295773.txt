Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, we will store all the variables used in the equations in one list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow rate through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Rotational speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Rotational speed of pump1
- `pump_V`: Displacement volume of the pump
- `pump1_V`: Displacement volume of pump1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinear3

Please note that the actual Python code would require the definition of the variables and parameters, as well as the implementation of the numerical integration for the differential equations to simulate the system dynamics over time.
