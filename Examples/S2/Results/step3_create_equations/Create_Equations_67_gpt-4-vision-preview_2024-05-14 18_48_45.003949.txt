Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `pump_N`: Speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinear3
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pump
- `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear3
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank
- `pump_V`: Volume of the pump
- `pump1_V`: Volume of pump1

Note: The equations are based on the assumption that the flow through the pumps and valves is proportional to their speed and opening fraction, respectively. The rate of change of the water level in the tanks is calculated by the difference between the inflow and outflow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The cross-sectional area is calculated using the diameter of the tank and assuming a circular cross-section.
