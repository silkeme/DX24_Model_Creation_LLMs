Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on flow in and out
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations based on valve opening and nominal flow
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Valve pressure drop equations based on nominal pressure drop
valveLinear1_dp = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_dp_nominal
valveLinear2_dp = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_dp_nominal
valveLinear3_dp = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_dp_nominal
```

Now, we will store all the variables in one list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear3_dp,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list contains the variables used in the equations, including the derivatives of the tank levels, the flow through the pumps and valves, and the pressure drops across the valves. The variables related to the pump and valve operations are also included, such as the pump speeds and valve openings. Additionally, the parameters for the tank diameters and the nominal values for the valve flows and pressure drops are part of the list.
