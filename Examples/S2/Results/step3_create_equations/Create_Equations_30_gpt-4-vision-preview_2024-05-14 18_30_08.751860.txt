Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1
- `tank2_level`: Water level in tank2
- `tank_level`: Water level in tank
- `pump_N`: Speed of the pump
- `pump1_N`: Speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Opening of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Opening of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Opening of valveLinear3
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pump
- `pump1_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of pump1
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow of valveLinear3
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank

The equations are based on the assumption that the fluid is incompressible, there are no energy losses, the process is adiabatic, and the tanks are open. The flow through the pumps is assumed to be proportional to their speed, and the flow through the valves is assumed to be proportional to their opening. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is calculated based on the difference between the inflow and outflow, divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank.
