Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, we will store all the variables used in the equations in one list:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump_N, pump_V, pump1_flow, pump1_N, pump1_V,
    der_tank1_level, valveLinear1_V_flow, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank_level, tank_Diameter, pump1_flow,
    der_tank2_level, valveLinear3_V_flow, tank2_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Symbols used:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution
- `pump1_flow`: Volume flow through pump1
- `pump1_N`: Pump1 speed control variable
- `pump1_V`: Pump1 volume per revolution
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `valveLinear1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank
- `tank_Diameter`: Diameter of tank
- `der_tank2_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank2
- `valveLinear3_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear3
- `tank2_Diameter`: Diameter of tank2
- `valveLinear1_opening`: Control variable for valveLinear1 opening
- `valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valveLinear1
- `valveLinear2_V_flow`: Volume flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear2_opening`: Control variable for valveLinear2 opening
- `valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valveLinear2
- `valveLinear3_opening`: Control variable for valveLinear3 opening
- `valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valveLinear3

Please note that the actual Python code would require the definition of these variables, parameters, and control variables, as well as the integration of the differential equations to simulate the system over time.
