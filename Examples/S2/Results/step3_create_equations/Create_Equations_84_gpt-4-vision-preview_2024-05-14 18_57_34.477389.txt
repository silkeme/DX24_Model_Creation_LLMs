Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pumps and valves and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

Here are the equations for the system:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_m_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_m_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_m_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_m_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_m_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_m_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Valve pressure drop equations
valveLinear1_dp = valveLinear1_m_flow ** 2 / valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal ** 2 * valveLinear1_dp_nominal
valveLinear2_dp = valveLinear2_m_flow ** 2 / valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal ** 2 * valveLinear2_dp_nominal
valveLinear3_dp = valveLinear3_m_flow ** 2 / valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal ** 2 * valveLinear3_dp_nominal
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_m_flow, valveLinear2_m_flow, valveLinear3_m_flow,
    valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear3_dp,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations. Note that the actual Python code would require defining these variables and parameters, as well as solving the differential equations for the tank levels over time. However, for this step, we are only asked to create the equations and list the variables.
