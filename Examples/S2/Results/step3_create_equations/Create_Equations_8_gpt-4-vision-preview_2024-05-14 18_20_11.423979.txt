Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
