Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the pumps and valves, and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

Here are the equations for the system:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_m_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_m_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_m_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_m_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_m_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_m_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Update tank levels
tank1_level += der_tank1_level * time
tank2_level += der_tank2_level * time
tank_level += der_tank_level * time
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_flow, pump1_flow, der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_m_flow, valveLinear2_m_flow, valveLinear3_m_flow, tank1_level,
    tank2_level, tank_level, pump_N, pump1_N, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening, pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter, pump_V, pump1_V
]
```

This list includes all the variables that appear in the equations, as well as the time variable and the control variables for the pumps and valves. The parameters for the nominal flow rates and diameters of the tanks are also included, as they are necessary for calculating the flow rates and tank levels.
