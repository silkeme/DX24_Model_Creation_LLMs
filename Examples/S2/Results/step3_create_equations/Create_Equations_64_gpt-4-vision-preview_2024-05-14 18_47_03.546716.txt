Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create a dynamical model for the process system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water.
- The fluid is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses.
- The process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open.

Let's define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tanks:

```python
# Equations for pumps
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Equations for tanks
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Equations for valves
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# List of all variables
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter,
    pump_V, pump1_V
]
