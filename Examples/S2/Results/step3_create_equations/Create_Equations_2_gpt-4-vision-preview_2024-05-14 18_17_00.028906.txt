Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pumps and valves and a simple mass balance for the tanks.

First, let's define the equations for the pumps, valves, and tanks:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
pump1_flow = pump1_N / pump1_N_Nominal * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_flow - pump1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_flow - valveLinear3_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_flow, pump1_flow,
    valveLinear1_flow, valveLinear2_flow, valveLinear3_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank_level, der_tank2_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    pump_N_Nominal, pump1_N_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    tank1_Diameter, tank_Diameter, tank2_Diameter
]
```

Please note that the above code is not executable as is. It is a representation of the equations and variables that would be used in a Python or OpenModelica environment to simulate the system. The actual implementation would require additional code to initialize these variables, perform the simulation over time, and handle the numerical integration of the differential equations.
