Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the following assumptions:

- The fluid in the system is water, which is incompressible.
- There are no energy losses, and the process is adiabatic.
- The tanks are open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the water surface is constant.

Let's define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tanks.

For the pumps, we can use the pump speed (N) and the pump volume (V) to calculate the volume flow rate. For the valves, we can use the valve opening and the nominal flow rate to calculate the actual flow rate. For the tanks, we can use the conservation of mass to relate the inflow, outflow, and the rate of change of the tank level.

Here are the equations:

```python
# Pump equations
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V
pump1_V_flow = pump1_N * pump1_V

# Valve equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equations (derived from mass balance)
der_tank1_level = (pump_V_flow - valveLinear1_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (pump_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - pump1_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Tank volume equations
tank1_fluidVolume = tank1_level * 3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2
tank2_fluidVolume = tank2_level * 3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2
tank_fluidVolume = tank_level * 3.1415 * (tank_Diameter / 2) ** 2
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_V_flow, pump1_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank_level,
    tank1_fluidVolume, tank2_fluidVolume, tank_fluidVolume,
    tank1_level, tank2_level, tank_level,
    pump_N, pump1_N,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank_Diameter,
    pump_V, pump1_V,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables directly from the equations, as well as the control variables and parameters that are used within them.
