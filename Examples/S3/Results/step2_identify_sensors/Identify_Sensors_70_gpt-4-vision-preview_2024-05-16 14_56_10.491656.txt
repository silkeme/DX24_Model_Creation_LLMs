Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1   |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                  |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear2 to tank2   |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                  |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to tank3   |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                  |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear4 to tank4   |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                  |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear6 to Outlet  |

Each sensor is placed according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the sensor number and its type, as per the diagram.
