Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the instructions for identifying sensors, here is the table with the sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1   |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                   |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to tank2   |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                   |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to valveLinear3 |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                   |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4   |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                   |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet  |

The sensor "valveLinear7" mentioned in the table is not visible in the P&ID, so it cannot be included in the sensor placement table. The inputs and outputs for "valveLinear7" are also listed as "Unclear," which further confirms that it is not depicted in the diagram provided.
