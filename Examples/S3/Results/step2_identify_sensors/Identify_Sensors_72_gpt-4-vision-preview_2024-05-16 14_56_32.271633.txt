Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1       |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear2 to tank2       |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                      |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to tank3       |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                      |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear4 to tank4       |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                      |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear6 to Outlet      |

The placement of flow indicators is determined by the elements they are connected to above the pipe, and the placement of level indicators is indicated by the tank they are associated with on the right side. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors in the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear based on the table provided.
