Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1   |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                   |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2   |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                   |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3   |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                   |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4   |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                   |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet  |

The sensor placement for flow indicators is determined by the elements the pipe is connected to, which are listed in the table. The level indicators are placed at the right side of the tanks as per the instructions. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors that can be identified from the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear in the table provided.
