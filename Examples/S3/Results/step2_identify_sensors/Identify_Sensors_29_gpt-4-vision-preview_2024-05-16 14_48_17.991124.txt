Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The valveLinear7 is not connected to any visible elements in the diagram, and therefore, it is not possible to determine its placement or associated sensors. The sensors listed above match the numbers and types indicated in the P&ID. Each sensor is placed according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting the elements.
