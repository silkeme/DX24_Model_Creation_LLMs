Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements. Here is the table with the required information:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The valveLinear7 is not connected to any visible elements in the diagram, so it cannot be associated with any sensors. The sensors listed in the table correspond to the numbers and types indicated in the P&ID. Each sensor is placed according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting the elements.
