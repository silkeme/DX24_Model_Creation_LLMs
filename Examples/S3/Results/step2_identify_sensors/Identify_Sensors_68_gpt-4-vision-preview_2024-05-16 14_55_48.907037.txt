Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to tank1            |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | tank1 to tank2            |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear1 to valveLinear7 |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | tank3 to tank4            |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | tank4 to Outlet           |

Please note that the sensor placement for flow indicators (FI) is described by the elements the pipe is connected to, and for level indicators (LI), the placement is simply the tank they are associated with. ValveLinear7 is not connected in a way that is clear from the diagram, so I cannot determine its exact placement. However, there is a flow indicator (FI 15) on a pipe that seems to be connected to valveLinear1 and leads to an unclear destination, which could potentially be valveLinear7.
