Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the sensors and their placements as follows:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The table lists the sensors by their names (FI for Flow Indicator and LI for Level Indicator), their types (Flow or Level), and their placements in the system. The placements for flow indicators are described by the elements they are connected to, while the level indicators are simply placed at the respective tanks.
