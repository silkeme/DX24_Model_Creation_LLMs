Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The table lists the sensors by their names (e.g., FI 13, LI 21), their types (Flow or Level), and their placement in the system. The level indicators (LI) are placed at the respective tanks, while the flow indicators (FI) are placed on the pipes connecting different elements as specified. ValveLinear7 and its associated sensors are not clearly indicated in the diagram, so they are not included in the table.
