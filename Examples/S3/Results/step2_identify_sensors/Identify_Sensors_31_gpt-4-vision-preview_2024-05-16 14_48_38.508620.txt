Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The table lists the sensors by their name (e.g., FI 13 for Flow Indicator 13), their type (Flow or Level), and their placement in the system, which is determined by the elements they are connected to or the tank they are associated with. The level indicators (LI) are placed at the right side of the tanks, and the flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes connecting different elements. ValveLinear7 and its connections are not clear in the diagram, so no sensor information can be provided for it.
