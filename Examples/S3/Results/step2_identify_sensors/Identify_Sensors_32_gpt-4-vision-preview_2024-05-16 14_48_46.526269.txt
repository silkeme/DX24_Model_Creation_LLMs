Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to tank1            |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | tank1 to tank2            |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | tank1 to tank3            |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | tank3 to tank4            |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | tank4 to Outlet           |

The sensor placement for flow indicators (FI) is determined by the elements the pipe is connected to, and for level indicators (LI), it is the tank where the sensor is located. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors according to the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear in the table provided.
