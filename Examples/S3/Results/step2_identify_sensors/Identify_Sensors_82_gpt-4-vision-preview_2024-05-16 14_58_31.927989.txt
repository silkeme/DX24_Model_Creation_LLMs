Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table based on the P&ID:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The sensor placement for flow indicators (FI) is determined by the elements to which the pipe is connected, and for level indicators (LI), it is simply the tank next to which they are placed. ValveLinear7 and its connections are unclear, so they are not included in the table.
