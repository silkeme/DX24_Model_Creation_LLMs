Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear5 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Please note that the sensor placement for flow indicators is between two elements (e.g., from one element to another), while for level indicators, it is simply the tank where the sensor is located. ValveLinear7 and its connections are not clear from the diagram, so they are not included in the table.
