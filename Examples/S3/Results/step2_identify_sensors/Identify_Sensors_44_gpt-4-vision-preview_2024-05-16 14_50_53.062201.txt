Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements as follows:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Each sensor is correctly placed according to the rules: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting the elements. There are no flow indicators below any pipe, and each sensor number is unique to one sensor.
