Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1       |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to tank1       |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                      |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3       |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                      |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4       |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                      |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet      |

Each sensor is placed according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is only one sensor per number, and the type and number combination is consistent with the image.
