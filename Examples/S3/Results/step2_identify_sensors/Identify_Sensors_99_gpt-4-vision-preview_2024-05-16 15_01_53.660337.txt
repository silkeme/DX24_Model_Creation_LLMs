Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements. Here is the table with the required information:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1       |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                       |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to tank1       |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                       |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3       |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                       |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4       |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                       |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet      |

Note that valveLinear7 is not connected in the diagram, and therefore, it does not have a clear input or output. Consequently, there are no sensors associated with it in the diagram. The placements of the flow indicators (FI) are determined by the pipes they are above, connecting two elements, and the level indicators (LI) are placed to the right of the tanks they are associated with.
