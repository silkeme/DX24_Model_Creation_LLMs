Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements. Here is the table with the required information:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1       |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear1 to tank1       |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| tank1 to valveLinear3       |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                      |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| tank2 to valveLinear4       |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                      |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| tank4 to valveLinear6       |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                      |

Each sensor is placed according to the rules stated: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is no sensor with the same number more than once, and each sensor type and number combination is unique in the diagram.
