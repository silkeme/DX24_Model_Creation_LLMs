Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1   |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                   |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear2 to tank2   |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                   |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3   |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                   |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4   |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                   |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet  |

This table lists all the sensors visible in the P&ID, their types, and their placements between the elements as per the diagram. Each sensor is placed either at the right side of the tanks for level indicators or above the pipes for flow indicators, as per the instructions.
