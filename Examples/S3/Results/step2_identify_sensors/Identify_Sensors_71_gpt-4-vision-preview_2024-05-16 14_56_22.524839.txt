Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The sensor placements for flow indicators are determined by the elements they are connected to above the pipe, and for level indicators, they are placed at the right side of the tanks as per the instructions. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors in the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear, so it is not included in the table.
