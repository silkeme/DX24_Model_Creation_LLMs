Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the instructions given, I will identify the sensors and their placements. Here is the table with the required information:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The table lists the sensor names as they appear on the P&ID, their types (either flow or level indicators), and their placements between elements or on specific tanks. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors in the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear, so it is not included in the table.
