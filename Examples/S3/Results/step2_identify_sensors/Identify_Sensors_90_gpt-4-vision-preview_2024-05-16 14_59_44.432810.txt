Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements as follows:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear1 to tank1     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The sensor FI 14 is placed between valveLinear1 and tank1, which matches the table's information that valveLinear1 outputs to tank1. Similarly, the other flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes that connect the elements as per the table's input-output relationships. The level indicators (LI) are correctly placed on the right side of the tanks as specified in the instructions. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors in the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear in the table provided.
