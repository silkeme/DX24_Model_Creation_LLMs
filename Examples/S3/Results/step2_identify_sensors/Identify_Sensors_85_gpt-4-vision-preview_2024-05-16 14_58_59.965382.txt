Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table based on the P&ID:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to tank1              |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| tank1 to tank2              |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                      |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| tank1 to tank3              |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                      |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| tank2 to tank4              |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                      |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| tank4 to Outlet             |

The sensor placements for flow indicators are determined by the elements they are connected to, which are the inputs and outputs of the flow path. The level indicators are placed at the respective tanks as per the P&ID conventions mentioned. ValveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors according to the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear in the table provided.
