Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The sensor "valveLinear7" mentioned in the table does not have a clear input or output, and it is not shown in the P&ID. Therefore, it cannot be placed in the sensor table.
