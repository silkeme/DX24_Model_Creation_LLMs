Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to tank1            |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | tank1 to tank2            |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear1 to valveLinear7 |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | tank3 to tank4            |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | tank4 to Outlet           |

Note: The sensor FI 15 is placed on a pipe that connects valveLinear1 to an unclear destination, which might be valveLinear7, but this is not explicitly shown in the diagram. The placement is inferred based on the available information and the typical P&ID conventions.
