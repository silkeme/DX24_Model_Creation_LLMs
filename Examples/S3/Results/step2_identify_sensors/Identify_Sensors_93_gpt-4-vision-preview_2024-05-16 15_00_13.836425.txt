Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement            |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator| Inlet to valveLinear1       |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear1 to tank1       |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                      |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear3 to tank3       |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                      |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear4 to tank4       |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                      |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator| valveLinear6 to Outlet      |

Note that valveLinear7 is not connected to any sensors in the diagram, and its inputs and outputs are unclear in the table provided. Therefore, it is not included in the sensor placement table.
