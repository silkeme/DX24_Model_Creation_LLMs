Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Please note that the sensor placement for flow indicators is between two elements (e.g., from one element to another), while for level indicators, the placement is simply the tank where the level is being measured. ValveLinear7 and its connections are not clear from the diagram, so no sensors are associated with it in this table.
