Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator | tank1                    |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to tank1     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator | tank2                    |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator | tank3                    |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator | tank4                    |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Please note that valveLinear7 is not connected in the diagram, and therefore, it is not included in the sensor placement. The placements of the flow indicators are determined by the pipes they are above, connecting two elements, and the level indicators are placed at the right side of the tanks as specified.
