Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to tank1            |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | tank1 to tank2            |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear1 to valveLinear7 |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | tank3 to tank4            |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | tank4 to Outlet           |

Please note that valveLinear7 is not connected in a way that is clear from the diagram, and therefore, the placement of FI 15 is assumed to be between valveLinear1 and valveLinear7 based on the available information. If this is incorrect, please provide additional context or correct the diagram.
