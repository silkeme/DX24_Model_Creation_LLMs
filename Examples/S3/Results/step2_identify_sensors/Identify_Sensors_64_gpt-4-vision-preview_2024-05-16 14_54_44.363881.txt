Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to tank1            |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | tank1 to tank2            |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | tank3 to tank4            |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | tank4 to Outlet           |

Note that valveLinear7 is not connected to any elements in the diagram, and therefore, it does not have any associated sensors. The flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes, indicating the flow direction between two elements, while the level indicators (LI) are placed on the right side of the tanks, indicating the level within those tanks. Each sensor number is unique and corresponds to a specific sensor type and placement.
