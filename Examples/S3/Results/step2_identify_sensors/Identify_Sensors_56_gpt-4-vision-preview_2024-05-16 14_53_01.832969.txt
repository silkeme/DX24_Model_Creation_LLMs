Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements as follows:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1      |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                      |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear2 to tank2      |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                      |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3      |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                      |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4      |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                      |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet     |

The sensor placement for flow indicators (FI) is determined by the elements they are connected to, which are the inlet and outlet of the pipes above which they are placed. The level indicators (LI) are placed on the right side of the tanks they are associated with. ValveLinear7 and its connections are not clear in the diagram, so no sensors can be associated with it.
