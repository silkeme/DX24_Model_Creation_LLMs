Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I can identify the sensors and their placements as follows:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow        | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level       | tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow        | valveLinear1 to tank1     |
| LI 22       | Level       | tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow        | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level       | tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow        | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level       | tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow        | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Please note that the sensor FI 14 is incorrectly placed in the diagram as it should be above the pipe between valveLinear1 and tank1, but it is shown above the pipe between tank1 and valveLinear2. Similarly, FI 15 should be above the pipe between valveLinear3 and tank3, but it is shown above the pipe between tank1 and valveLinear3. These discrepancies should be addressed for accurate representation in the P&ID.

ValveLinear7 is not connected in the diagram, and therefore, it is not possible to determine its inputs and outputs or associate any sensors with it.
