Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear2 to tank2     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

The sensor "valveLinear7" mentioned in the table is not visible in the P&ID, so it cannot be included in the sensor identification table. The placements of the sensors are determined by their position relative to the elements they are connected to, as per the instructions provided.
