Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements, inputs, and outputs, I will identify the sensors and create a table with the required columns: sensor name, sensor type, and sensor placement.

Here is the table with the identified sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type   | Sensor Placement          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FI 13       | Flow Indicator | Inlet to valveLinear1     |
| LI 21       | Level Indicator| tank1                     |
| FI 14       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear1 to tank1     |
| LI 22       | Level Indicator| tank2                     |
| FI 15       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear3 to tank3     |
| LI 23       | Level Indicator| tank3                     |
| FI 16       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear4 to tank4     |
| LI 24       | Level Indicator| tank4                     |
| FI 17       | Flow Indicator | valveLinear6 to Outlet    |

Note: The sensor "valveLinear7" mentioned in the table is not visible in the P&ID provided, so it cannot be included in the sensor identification table. The placements of the flow indicators are determined by the direction of the flow, which is from the input element to the output element, and they are located above the pipes. The level indicators are placed on the right side of the respective tanks as per the instructions.
