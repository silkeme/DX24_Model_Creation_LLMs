Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the volume flow through the valves and the fluid level in the tanks. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

```python
# Valve flow equations using the valveLinearX_V_flow, valveLinearX_opening, and valveLinearX_dp_nominal
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear7_V_flow = valveLinear7_opening * valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valveLinear7_dp / valveLinear7_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level equations using the continuity equation
# Assuming cross-sectional area A = pi * (Diameter/2)^2
# Volume V = A * Height
# Inflow - Outflow = dV/dt
# dV/dt = A * dH/dt
# dH/dt = (Inflow - Outflow) / A

# Tank 1
tank1_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area

# Tank 2
tank2_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area

# Tank 3
tank3_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area

# Tank 4
tank4_cross_sectional_area = 3.14159 * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, we will store all the variables in a list as requested:

```python
variables = [
    time, tank1_level, tank2_level, tank3_level, tank4_level,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_opening,
    valveLinear7_V_flow, valveLinear7_dp, valveLinear7_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank2_cross_sectional_area, tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank4_cross_sectional_area
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X
- `valveLinearX_dp`: Pressure drop across valve X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0-1)
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X
- `valveLinearX_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve X
- `tankX_level`: Fluid level in tank X
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X
- `tankX_cross_sectional_area`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `time`: Time variable

Please note that the actual values for the parameters like `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`, `valveLinearX_dp_nominal`, `tankX_Diameter`, etc., need to be provided to complete the model. The equations assume that the flow through the valves is a function of the valve opening and the pressure drop across the valve, which is a common assumption for valve flow in engineering models. The tank level equations are derived from the basic principle of conservation of mass (continuity equation) for incompressible fluids.
