Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, we define the equations for the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate. We assume a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, we can create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank2_cross_sectional_area,
    tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank4_cross_sectional_area,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list contains all the variables that are present in the equations we have defined. The variables starting with 'der' represent the derivatives of the tank levels with respect to time, indicating how the water level in each tank changes over time. The variables ending with '_Diameter' and '_Flow_Nominal' are parameters that define the physical properties of the tanks and the nominal flow rates of the valves, respectively. The variables ending with '_cross_sectional_area' are calculated based on the tank diameters and represent the cross-sectional areas of the tanks, which are used in the mass balance equations to determine the rate of change of the water level. The variables ending with '_opening' are control variables that represent the opening of the valves, which can be adjusted to control the flow rate through each valve.
