Based on the provided table, variable names, parameter names, control variable names, and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for valve flow rates based on valve opening and nominal flow rate
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal

# Equations for tank levels based on inflow, outflow, and tank cross-sectional area (A = Ï€ * d^2 / 4)
tank1_A = 3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter ** 2) / 4
tank2_A = 3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter ** 2) / 4
tank3_A = 3.14159 * (tank3_Diameter ** 2) / 4
tank4_A = 3.14159 * (tank4_Diameter ** 2) / 4

# Differential equations for tank levels based on continuity equation (dV/dt = Qin - Qout)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_A
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_A
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_A
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_A

# Assuming the tanks are open and the process is adiabatic, we do not need to calculate temperature or pressure changes
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    tank1_A, tank2_A, tank3_A, tank4_A,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the tank cross-sectional areas, the derivatives of the tank levels, the valve openings, the tank diameters, and the nominal flow rates for the valves.
