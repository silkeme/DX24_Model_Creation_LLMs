Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve, assuming a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_Area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_Area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_Area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_Area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_Area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_Area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_Area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Area, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Area, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Area, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Area, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, the volume flow through each valve, and the rate of change of the water level in each tank. The variables starting with 'der' represent the derivatives of the tank levels with respect to time.

Note: The actual Python code would require the definition of the parameters and control variables, as well as the implementation of the equations in a simulation environment. The provided code is a simplified representation of the model equations and variable list.
