Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Tank level differential equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Since valveLinear7 is not connected, we do not include it in the equations
```

Now, we will store all the variables in one list:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    tank1_Height, tank2_Height, tank3_Height, tank4_Height,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `der_tankX_level`: Time derivative of the water level in tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (where X is the valve number, between 0 and 1).
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `tankX_Height`: Height of tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate through valve X when fully open (where X is the valve number).

Note: The actual Python code would require the definition of the parameters and control variables, as well as the integration of the differential equations to simulate the system over time.
