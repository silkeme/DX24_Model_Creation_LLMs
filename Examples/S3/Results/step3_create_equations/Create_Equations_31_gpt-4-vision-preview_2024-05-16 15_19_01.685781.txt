Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the tanks' levels. Since the process is adiabatic and there are no energy losses, we will not consider heat transfer or friction losses.

The equations for the flow through each valve can be modeled as a function of the valve opening and the pressure difference across the valve. The level in each tank can be modeled using the principle of conservation of mass.

Here are the equations for the model:

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level equations based on mass conservation
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_dp_nominal, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_dp_nominal, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_dp_nominal, valveLinear6_opening,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the derivatives of the tank levels, the tank diameters, the nominal flow rates and pressure drops for the valves, and the valve openings.
