Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, we define the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate, assuming a linear relationship between valve opening and flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we define the mass balance for each tank, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank. This is equal to the inflow rate minus the outflow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (assuming the tank cross-section is constant):

```python
A1 = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
A2 = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
A3 = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
A4 = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / A1
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / A2
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / A3
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / A4
```

Now, we can create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    A1, A2, A3, A4,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    tank1_Flow_Nominal, tank2_Flow_Nominal, tank3_Flow_Nominal, tank4_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the flow through each valve, the rate of change of the water level in each tank, the cross-sectional area of each tank, the valve openings, and the tank diameters and nominal flow rates.

Symbols used:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X
- `AX`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0-1)
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X
- `tankX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of tank X

Note: The actual Python code would need to define the parameters and control variables as well as the equations for the valveLinear7, which is not connected in the system diagram. Since it is not connected, we do not include it in the model.
