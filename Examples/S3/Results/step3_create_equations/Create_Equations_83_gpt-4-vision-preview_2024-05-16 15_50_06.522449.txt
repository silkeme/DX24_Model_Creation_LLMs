Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_cross_sectional_area,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, the volume flow through each valve, and the derivative of the tank levels. The cross-sectional areas are calculated based on the tank diameters, assuming the tanks are cylindrical.

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X
- `tankX_cross_sectional_area`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X

Note: The actual Python code would require the definition of the parameters and control variables as well as the implementation of the equations in a simulation environment. The equations provided here are symbolic and represent the relationships between the variables in the system.
