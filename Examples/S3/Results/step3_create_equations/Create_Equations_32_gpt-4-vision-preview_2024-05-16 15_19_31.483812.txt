Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Valve pressure drop (not used in the equations due to the assumption of no energy losses)
valveLinear1_dp = valveLinear1_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear1_opening)
valveLinear2_dp = valveLinear2_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear2_opening)
valveLinear3_dp = valveLinear3_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear3_opening)
valveLinear4_dp = valveLinear4_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear4_opening)
valveLinear5_dp = valveLinear5_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear5_opening)
valveLinear6_dp = valveLinear6_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear6_opening)

# Since valveLinear7 is unclear, we exclude it from the model
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, valveLinear4_V_flow,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, valveLinear5_V_flow,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_opening,
    valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_dp_nominal
]
```

This list contains all the variables that appear in the equations, including the derivatives of the tank levels and the flow through each valve. The parameters for the tank diameters and valve nominal flows and pressure drops are also included. The control variables for the valve openings are part of the list as well.
