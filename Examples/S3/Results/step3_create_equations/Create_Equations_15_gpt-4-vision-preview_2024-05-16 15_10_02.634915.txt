Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_Area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_Area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_Area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_Area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_Area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_Area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_Area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_Area, tank2_Area, tank3_Area, tank4_Area,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the derivatives of the tank levels, the tank cross-sectional areas, the valve openings, the nominal flow rates of the valves, and the tank diameters.

Note that we have not included `valveLinear7` in the equations or the variables list because it is marked as "Unclear" in the table and cannot be identified in the image. If it were to be included, we would need additional information about its connections and parameters.
