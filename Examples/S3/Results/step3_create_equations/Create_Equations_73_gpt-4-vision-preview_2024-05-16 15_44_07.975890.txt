Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tanks. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Tank level differential equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X.
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0-1).
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X.
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X.
- `3.141592653589793`: Value of Ï€ to calculate the cross-sectional area of the tanks.

Note: The equations assume that the flow through each valve is proportional to its opening and the nominal flow rate. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is calculated by the net inflow or outflow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The tanks are assumed to be cylindrical, and the cross-sectional area is calculated using the diameter of the tank.
