Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, we define the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate, assuming a linear relationship between valve opening and flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we calculate the change in water level in each tank using the mass balance equation. The rate of change of the water level in a tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_Area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_Area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_Area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_Area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_Area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_Area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_Area
```

Now, we can create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_Area, tank2_Area, tank3_Area, tank4_Area,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, the volume flow through each valve, and the parameters for the tank diameters and nominal flow rates of the valves. The valve opening variables are control variables that can be adjusted in the system.

Note: The actual Python code would require defining these variables and parameters properly, and the equations would need to be integrated into a simulation environment to solve the dynamics over time. The above code is a simplified representation of the model equations.
