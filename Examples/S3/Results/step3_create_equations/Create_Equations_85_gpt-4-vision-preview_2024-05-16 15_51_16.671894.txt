Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve using the valveLinearX_V_flow, valveLinearX_dp, and valveLinearX_opening variables, where X is the valve number. We will assume a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate, and that the pressure drop across the valve is proportional to the square of the flow rate.

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)
# valveLinear7 is not connected in the system, so we exclude it from the model

# Tank level equations based on mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (pi * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (pi * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (pi * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (pi * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list as requested:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_opening,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    tank1_Height, tank2_Height, tank3_Height, tank4_Height,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_dp_nominal, valveLinear5_dp_nominal, valveLinear6_dp_nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the derivatives of the tank levels, the tank dimensions, the nominal flow rates for the valves, and the nominal pressure drops for the valves.
