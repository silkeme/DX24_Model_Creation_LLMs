Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal

# Valve pressure drop (not used in the equations due to the assumption of no energy losses)
valveLinear1_dp = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_dp_nominal
valveLinear2_dp = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_dp_nominal
valveLinear3_dp = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_dp_nominal
valveLinear4_dp = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_dp_nominal
valveLinear5_dp = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_dp_nominal
valveLinear6_dp = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_dp_nominal

# Since valveLinear7 is unclear, we exclude it from the model
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, valveLinear4_V_flow,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, valveLinear5_V_flow,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_dp_nominal
]
```

This list includes the derivatives of the tank levels, the valve flows, the valve openings, and the nominal flow and pressure drop parameters for each valve. The valve pressure drop variables are included for completeness, even though they are not used in the model due to the assumption of no energy losses. ValveLinear7 is excluded from the model as its connections are unclear.
