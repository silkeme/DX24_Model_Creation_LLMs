Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve, assuming a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank2_cross_sectional_area,
    tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank4_cross_sectional_area,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, the volume flow through each valve, and the parameters for the diameters and nominal flows of the valves. The equations assume that the valve opening is between 0 (closed) and 1 (fully open), and that the flow through a valve is proportional to its opening.

Note: The actual Python code would require defining these variables and parameters properly, and the equations would need to be integrated over time to simulate the system's behavior. This is just a representation of the equations and variables for the model.
