Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal

# Since valveLinear7 is not connected, we do not include it in the model
```

Now, we will store all the variables in a list:

```python
variables = [
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, valveLinear4_V_flow,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, valveLinear5_V_flow,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `der_tankX_level`: Time derivative of the water level in tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valveLinearX
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valveLinearX (0-1)
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valveLinearX when fully open

Note: The equations assume that the valve opening is directly proportional to the flow rate, which is a simplification and may not hold true for all valve types and flow conditions. The actual flow rate through a valve can be affected by the pressure differential across the valve and other factors.
