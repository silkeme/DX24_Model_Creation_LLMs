Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, we define the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate, assuming a linear relationship between valve opening and flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening
```

Next, we define the mass balance for each tank, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank. This is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (assuming the area is constant):

```python
A1 = (3.14159 * tank1_Diameter**2) / 4
A2 = (3.14159 * tank2_Diameter**2) / 4
A3 = (3.14159 * tank3_Diameter**2) / 4
A4 = (3.14159 * tank4_Diameter**2) / 4

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / A1
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / A2
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / A3
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / A4
```

Now, we can create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    A1, A2, A3, A4
]
```

This list includes the flow rates through each valve and the rate of change of the water level in each tank. The cross-sectional areas of the tanks are also included as they are used in the mass balance equations.

Note: The actual Python code would require the definition of the parameters and control variables, as well as the implementation of the equations in a simulation environment. The provided code is a simplified representation of the model equations.
