Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the fluid levels in the tanks and the volume flow through the valves. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to relate the pressure drop across a valve to the flow rate and the valve opening. We will also use the continuity equation to relate the change in tank level to the inflow and outflow rates.

Here are the equations for the model:

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear7_V_flow = valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear7_opening * (1 - (valveLinear7_dp / valveLinear7_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level differential equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2)

# Tank level static equations
tank1_level = tank1_Height - der_tank1_level * time
tank2_level = tank2_Height - der_tank2_level * time
tank3_level = tank3_Height - der_tank3_level * time
tank4_level = tank4_Height - der_tank4_level * time
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear7_V_flow, valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear7_opening, valveLinear7_dp, valveLinear7_dp_nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, tank1_Height, time,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, tank2_Height,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, tank3_Height,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter, tank4_Height,
    tank1_level, tank2_level, tank3_level, tank4_level
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, and the volume flow through each valve, as well as the derivatives of the tank levels. The static equations for the tank levels are also included, which assume a linear change in level over time. This is a simplification and in a real system, the levels would be determined by integrating the derivative equations over time.
