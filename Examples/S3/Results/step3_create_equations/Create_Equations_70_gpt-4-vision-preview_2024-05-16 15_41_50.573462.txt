Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (derived from mass balance)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear7_V_flow = valveLinear7_opening * valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter, valveLinear4_V_flow,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter, valveLinear5_V_flow,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear7_opening, valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list includes the derivative of the tank levels, the diameters of the tanks, the volume flow rates through the valves, and the openings of the valves along with their nominal flow rates. The equations assume that the valves have a linear characteristic, which means the flow through each valve is proportional to its opening. The tank level dynamics are derived from a simple mass balance, assuming the cross-sectional area of the tanks is circular and based on their diameters. The process is assumed to be adiabatic with no energy losses, and the fluid is incompressible water.
