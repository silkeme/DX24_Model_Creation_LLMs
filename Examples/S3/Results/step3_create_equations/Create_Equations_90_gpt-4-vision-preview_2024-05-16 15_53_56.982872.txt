Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve, assuming a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_opening,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_cross_sectional_area, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_cross_sectional_area, tank4_Diameter
]
```

Note that we have not included `valveLinear7` in the equations because it is marked as "Unclear" in the table and is not shown in the image. We also assume that the valve openings are controlled variables that can be set externally.

The symbols used in the equations are as follows:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number)
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0-1)
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X
- `tankX_cross_sectional_area`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X

This model assumes that the flow through each valve is proportional to its opening and that the tanks are well-mixed, meaning the level changes uniformly across the tank's cross-sectional area. The model also assumes that the process is adiabatic and there are no energy losses.
