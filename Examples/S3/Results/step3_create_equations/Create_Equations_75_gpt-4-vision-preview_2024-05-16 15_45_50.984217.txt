Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a set of equations for the fluid flow through the valves and the water level in each tank. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

First, let's define the equations for the volume flow through each valve, assuming a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening
```

Next, we'll define the equations for the water level in each tank using the continuity equation. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is equal to the inflow rate minus the outflow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank2_cross_sectional_area, tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank4_cross_sectional_area,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `der_tankX_level`: Derivative of the water level in tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `tankX_cross_sectional_area`: Cross-sectional area of tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X (where X is the valve number).

Note: The actual equations for the valve flow rates and tank levels would depend on additional factors such as the pressure difference across the valves, which is not provided here. The above equations assume a direct proportionality between valve opening and flow rate, which is a simplification.
