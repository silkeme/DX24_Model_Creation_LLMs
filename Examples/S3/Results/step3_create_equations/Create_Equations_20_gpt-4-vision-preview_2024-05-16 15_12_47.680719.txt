Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve using the valveLinearX_V_flow, valveLinearX_dp, and valveLinearX_opening variables, where X is the valve number:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank to calculate the water level. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_opening,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_cross_sectional_area,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_cross_sectional_area
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, and the volume flow through each valve. The equations assume that the flow through a valve is proportional to the opening of the valve and the square root of the pressure drop across the valve, which is a common assumption for turbulent flow in a valve. The mass balance equations for the tanks assume that the tanks are well-mixed, so the level in the tank depends only on the net flow into or out of the tank.
