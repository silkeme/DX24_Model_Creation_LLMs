Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the volume flow through the valves and the fluid level in the tanks. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Tank level differential equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `der_tankX_level`: Time derivative of the water level in tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (where X is the valve number, between 0 and 1).
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X (where X is the tank number).
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X (where X is the valve number).

Note: The equations assume that the flow through each valve is proportional to its opening and the nominal flow rate of the valve. The differential equations for the tank levels are derived from the continuity equation, considering the cross-sectional area of each tank and the flow rates in and out. The system is assumed to be adiabatic and without energy losses, and the fluid is incompressible. The tanks are open, which means the pressure at the water surface is atmospheric and does not affect the flow equations.
