Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a set of equations for the fluid levels in the tanks and the volume flow through the valves. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

For each valve, the flow rate \( Q \) can be calculated using the valve opening and the nominal flow rate:
\[ Q_{valve} = valveLinearX\_opening \times valveLinearX\_Flow\_Nominal \]

For each tank, the rate of change of the fluid level \( h \) can be calculated using the inflow and outflow rates and the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the tank:
\[ \frac{dh_{tankX}}{dt} = \frac{Q_{in} - Q_{out}}{A_{tankX}} \]

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of each tank can be calculated from the diameter \( D \):
\[ A_{tankX} = \frac{\pi \times tankX\_Diameter^2}{4} \]

Now, let's write down the equations for the system:

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear7_V_flow = valveLinear7_opening * valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal

# Tank cross-sectional areas
A_tank1 = (3.14159 * tank1_Diameter**2) / 4
A_tank2 = (3.14159 * tank2_Diameter**2) / 4
A_tank3 = (3.14159 * tank3_Diameter**2) / 4
A_tank4 = (3.14159 * tank4_Diameter**2) / 4

# Tank level rate of change equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / A_tank1
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / A_tank2
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / A_tank3
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / A_tank4
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear6_V_flow,
    valveLinear7_V_flow, A_tank1, A_tank2, A_tank3, A_tank4,
    der_tank1_level, der_tank2_level, der_tank3_level, der_tank4_level,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_opening,
    valveLinear7_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear7_Flow_Nominal
]
```

This list contains all the variables that are present in the equations we have created.
