Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, we define the equations for the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we define the mass balance for each tank, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank. This is equal to the inflow rate minus the outflow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (assuming the area at the top of the tank is the same as the base):

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_cross_sectional_area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_cross_sectional_area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_cross_sectional_area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_cross_sectional_area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_cross_sectional_area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_cross_sectional_area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, we can create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_cross_sectional_area, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_cross_sectional_area, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_cross_sectional_area, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_cross_sectional_area, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the level, inflow, and outflow of each tank, and the volume flow through each valve. The equations calculate the water level in each tank and the flow through each valve based on the given parameters and control variables.
