Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a set of equations for the fluid dynamics in the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

For each valveLinear, the volumetric flow rate `V_flow` can be calculated as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate at the nominal pressure drop:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)
```

For each tank, the rate of change of the water level `der_tankX_level` can be calculated from the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (assuming the tank cross-section is constant):

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * pi
tank2_Area = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * pi
tank3_Area = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * pi
tank4_Area = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * pi

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_Area
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_Area
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_Area
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_Area
```

Now, we can compile the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_dp_nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Area, der_tank2_level, tank2_Area, der_tank3_level, tank3_Area, der_tank4_level, tank4_Area,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter
]
```

Note that we have not included the variables for `valveLinear7` as it is marked as "Unclear" in the table and is not shown in the image. We also assume that the pressure drop across each valve (`valveLinearX_dp`) is known or can be measured, as it is not provided in the variable list.

The symbols used in the equations are as follows:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X
- `valveLinearX_dp`: Pressure drop across valve X
- `valveLinearX_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop for valve X
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X
- `tankX_Area`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X

This set of equations and variables provides a basic dynamic model for the water levels in the tanks and the volumetric flow rates through the valves.
