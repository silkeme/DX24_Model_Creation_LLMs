Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a set of equations for the fluid dynamics in the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to relate the flow through valves and the change in water level in the tanks. Since the process is adiabatic and there are no energy losses, we will not consider heat transfer or friction losses.

The equations for the flow through each valve can be given by:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

The equations for the change in water level in each tank can be given by the differential equations:

```python
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X (where X is the valve number).
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0 to 1).
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X when fully open.
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank X.
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X.

Note: The equations for the flow through the valves assume a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate, which is a simplification. In reality, the relationship can be more complex and may require additional parameters to accurately model.
