Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Valve pressure drop (not used in the equations due to the assumption of no energy losses)
valveLinear1_dp = valveLinear1_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear1_opening)
valveLinear2_dp = valveLinear2_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear2_opening)
valveLinear3_dp = valveLinear3_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear3_opening)
valveLinear4_dp = valveLinear4_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear4_opening)
valveLinear5_dp = valveLinear5_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear5_opening)
valveLinear6_dp = valveLinear6_dp_nominal * (1 - valveLinear6_opening)

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `der_tankX_level`: Time derivative of the water level in tank X.
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X.
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X.
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X.
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X (0-1).
- `valveLinearX_dp`: Pressure drop across valve X.
- `valveLinearX_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve X when fully open.

Note: The equations assume that the valve opening is directly proportional to the flow rate, which is a simplification. In reality, the relationship between valve opening and flow rate can be more complex and may require a more detailed valve model. Additionally, the pressure drop equations are not used in the model due to the assumption of no energy losses.
