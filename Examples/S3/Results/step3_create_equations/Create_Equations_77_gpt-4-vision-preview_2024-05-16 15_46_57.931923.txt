Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Equations for valve flow rates based on valve opening and nominal flow rate
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal

# Equations for tank levels based on inflow, outflow, and tank cross-sectional area (A = Ï€ * d^2 / 4)
tank1_A = 3.14159 * tank1_Diameter**2 / 4
tank2_A = 3.14159 * tank2_Diameter**2 / 4
tank3_A = 3.14159 * tank3_Diameter**2 / 4
tank4_A = 3.14159 * tank4_Diameter**2 / 4

# Differential equations for tank levels
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_A
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_A
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_A
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_A

Brief description of used symbols:
- `valveLinearX_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve X
- `valveLinearX_opening`: Opening fraction of valve X
- `valveLinearX_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve X
- `tankX_A`: Cross-sectional area of tank X
- `tankX_Diameter`: Diameter of tank X
- `der_tankX_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank X

Note: The valveLinear7 is not included in the equations as it is marked "Unclear" in the table and not shown in the image. The flow through each valve is assumed to be proportional to the valve opening and its nominal flow rate. The rate of change of the fluid level in each tank is calculated by the difference between the inflow and outflow divided by the tank's cross-sectional area. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, and there are no energy losses or heat transfer as the process is adiabatic and the tanks are open.
