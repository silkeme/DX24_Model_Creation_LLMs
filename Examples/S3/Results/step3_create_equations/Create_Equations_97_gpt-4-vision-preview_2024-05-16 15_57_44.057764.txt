Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

The Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow through a valve is given by:
\[ Q = C_v \sqrt{\Delta P} \]
where \( Q \) is the volumetric flow rate, \( C_v \) is the flow coefficient, and \( \Delta P \) is the pressure drop across the valve.

The mass balance for a tank with incompressible fluid is given by:
\[ A \frac{dh}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out} \]
where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the tank, \( h \) is the height of the fluid in the tank, \( Q_{in} \) is the inflow rate, and \( Q_{out} \) is the outflow rate.

We will use the provided variable names for the levels and flow rates, and the provided parameter names for the flow coefficients and nominal pressure drops. The control variables will represent the valve openings, which will modulate the flow coefficients.

Let's define the equations:

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**0.5
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**0.5
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**0.5
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**0.5
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**0.5
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**0.5

# Tank level equations
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_dp_nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes all the variables used in the equations, as well as the derivatives of the tank levels, which represent the rate of change of the water level in each tank. The valve flow equations are based on the assumption that the valve flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop across the valve, modulated by the valve opening. The tank level equations are derived from the mass balance, assuming the cross-sectional area of the tank is circular.
