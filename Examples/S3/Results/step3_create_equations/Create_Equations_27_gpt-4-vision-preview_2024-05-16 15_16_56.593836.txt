Based on the provided table, image, and variable names, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Tank level dynamics (derived from mass balance)
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2)
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / (3.1415 * (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2)

# Valve flow dynamics (assuming linear valve characteristics and no energy losses)
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening

# Since valveLinear7 is not connected, we do not include it in the model
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    der_tank1_level, valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear3_V_flow,
    tank1_Diameter, der_tank2_level, valveLinear4_V_flow, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, valveLinear5_V_flow, tank3_Diameter, der_tank4_level,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, tank4_Diameter, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_opening
]

This list contains all the variables that are present in the equations we have created. The variables starting with 'der' represent the derivatives of the tank levels with respect to time, indicating how the water level in each tank changes over time. The variables ending with '_V_flow' represent the volumetric flow rate through each valve, which is a function of the valve's nominal flow rate and its opening fraction. The variables ending with '_Diameter' are parameters representing the diameter of each tank, which are used to calculate the cross-sectional area for the level dynamics. The variables ending with '_Flow_Nominal' are parameters representing the nominal flow rate of each valve, and the variables ending with '_opening' are control variables representing the opening fraction of each valve.
