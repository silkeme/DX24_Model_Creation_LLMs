Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the flow through the valves and the mass balance for the tanks to model the water level.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve using the valveLinearX_V_flow, valveLinearX_dp, and valveLinearX_opening variables, where X is the valve number. We will assume a linear relationship between the valve opening and the flow rate, and that the pressure drop across the valve is proportional to the flow rate squared.

```python
# Valve flow equations
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear1_opening * (1 - (valveLinear1_dp / valveLinear1_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear2_opening * (1 - (valveLinear2_dp / valveLinear2_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear3_opening * (1 - (valveLinear3_dp / valveLinear3_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear4_opening * (1 - (valveLinear4_dp / valveLinear4_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear5_opening * (1 - (valveLinear5_dp / valveLinear5_dp_nominal)**2)
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal * valveLinear6_opening * (1 - (valveLinear6_dp / valveLinear6_dp_nominal)**2)
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for each tank. The rate of change of the water level in each tank is equal to the inflow rate minus the outflow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank.

```python
# Tank level equations
A_tank1 = (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
A_tank2 = (tank2_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
A_tank3 = (tank3_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
A_tank4 = (tank4_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159

der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / A_tank1
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / A_tank2
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / A_tank3
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / A_tank4
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_dp, valveLinear1_opening,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_dp, valveLinear2_opening,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_dp, valveLinear3_opening,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_dp, valveLinear4_opening,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_dp, valveLinear5_opening,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_dp, valveLinear6_opening,
    der_tank1_level, A_tank1,
    der_tank2_level, A_tank2,
    der_tank3_level, A_tank3,
    der_tank4_level, A_tank4,
    tank1_Diameter, tank2_Diameter, tank3_Diameter, tank4_Diameter,
    valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear1_dp_nominal, valveLinear2_dp_nominal, valveLinear3_dp_nominal,
    valveLinear4_dp_nominal, valveLinear5_dp_nominal, valveLinear6_dp_nominal
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the derivatives of the tank levels, the cross-sectional areas of the tanks, the diameters of the tanks, the nominal flow rates of the valves, and the nominal pressure drops across the valves.

Note that we have not included valveLinear7 in the equations or the variables list because it is marked as "Unclear" in the table and cannot be identified in the image.
