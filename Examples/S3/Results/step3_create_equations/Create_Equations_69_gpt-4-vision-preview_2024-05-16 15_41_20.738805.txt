Based on the provided table, image, and assumptions, we can create a set of equations for the fluid flow through the valves and the water level in the tanks. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow and the continuity equation for the tanks.

First, let's define the equations for the flow through each valve as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate:

```python
valveLinear1_V_flow = valveLinear1_opening * valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear2_V_flow = valveLinear2_opening * valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear3_V_flow = valveLinear3_opening * valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear4_V_flow = valveLinear4_opening * valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear5_V_flow = valveLinear5_opening * valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal
valveLinear6_V_flow = valveLinear6_opening * valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we'll define the equations for the water level in each tank using the derivative of the tank level with respect to time, which is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank:

```python
# Cross-sectional area of the tanks
tank1_A = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank2_A = (tank2_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank3_A = (tank3_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
tank4_A = (tank4_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159

# Derivatives of tank levels
der_tank1_level = (valveLinear1_V_flow - valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear3_V_flow) / tank1_A
der_tank2_level = (valveLinear2_V_flow - valveLinear4_V_flow) / tank2_A
der_tank3_level = (valveLinear3_V_flow - valveLinear5_V_flow) / tank3_A
der_tank4_level = (valveLinear4_V_flow + valveLinear5_V_flow - valveLinear6_V_flow) / tank4_A
```

Now, let's create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    valveLinear1_V_flow, valveLinear1_opening, valveLinear1_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear2_V_flow, valveLinear2_opening, valveLinear2_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear3_V_flow, valveLinear3_opening, valveLinear3_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear4_V_flow, valveLinear4_opening, valveLinear4_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear5_V_flow, valveLinear5_opening, valveLinear5_Flow_Nominal,
    valveLinear6_V_flow, valveLinear6_opening, valveLinear6_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_A, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank2_level, tank2_A, tank2_Diameter,
    der_tank3_level, tank3_A, tank3_Diameter,
    der_tank4_level, tank4_A, tank4_Diameter
]
```

This list includes the variables for the valve flow rates, the derivatives of the tank levels, the cross-sectional areas of the tanks, and the diameters of the tanks. The nominal flow rates and valve openings are control variables that can be adjusted in the system.

Note that we have not included `valveLinear7` in the equations because it was marked as "Unclear" in the table and is not shown in the image. If it were to be included, we would need additional information about its connections and parameters.
