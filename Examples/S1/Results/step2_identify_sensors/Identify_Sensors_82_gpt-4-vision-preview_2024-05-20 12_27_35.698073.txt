Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to Pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to Valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | Tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | Valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is correctly identified according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes. There is only one sensor per number, and the placement corresponds to the elements connected by the pipes where the sensors are located.
