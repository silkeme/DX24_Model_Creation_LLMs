Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to Pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to Valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | Tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | Valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is correctly identified according to its type and placement in the system. The flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes, and the level indicator (LI) is on the right side of the tank, as per the instructions.
