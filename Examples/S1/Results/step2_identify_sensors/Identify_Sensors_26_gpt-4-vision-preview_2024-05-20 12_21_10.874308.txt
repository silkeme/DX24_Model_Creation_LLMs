Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is correctly identified according to its type and placement in the P&ID. The flow indicators (FI) are placed above the pipes, and the level indicator (LI) is on the right side of the tank, as per the instructions.
