Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | pump to valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is correctly identified according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes. There is no overlap in numbering, and each sensor type corresponds to its placement in the system.
