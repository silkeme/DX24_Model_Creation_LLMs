Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with additional information, I can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is placed according to the conventions mentioned: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes. There are no flow indicators below any pipe. The sensor type and number combinations match the diagram, with each number corresponding to one sensor.
