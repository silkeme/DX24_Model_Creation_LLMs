Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to Pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to Valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | Tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | Valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is correctly identified according to the rules provided: level indicators (LI) are on the right side of the tanks, and flow indicators (FI) are above the pipes connecting two elements. There is one level indicator (LI 3) on Tank1 and three flow indicators (FI 1, FI 2, and FI 4) placed in the piping system as described.
