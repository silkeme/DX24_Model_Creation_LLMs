Based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) provided and the table with the elements and their connections, we can identify the following sensors:

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Sensor Placement        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FI 1        | Flow        | Inlet to Pump           |
| FI 2        | Flow        | Pump to Valve0          |
| LI 3        | Level       | Tank1                   |
| FI 4        | Flow        | Valve1 to Outlet        |

Each sensor is identified by its label (FI for Flow Indicator, LI for Level Indicator) and its number. The placement is determined by the location of the sensor in the diagram: for flow indicators, it's between the two elements it connects, and for level indicators, it's at the element where it's installed.
