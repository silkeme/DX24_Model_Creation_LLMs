Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tank level changes based on the difference between inflow and outflow.

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter'
]
```

This list includes the variables for the pump speed, pump volume flow, valve openings, valve volume flows, and the derivative of the tank level. The tank diameter is a parameter used to calculate the tank level change.

Symbols used:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume parameter
- `pump_V_flow`: Volume flow through the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Valve 0 opening control variable
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valve 0
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volume flow through valve 0
- `valve1_opening`: Valve 1 opening control variable
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valve 1
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valve 1
- `der_tank1_level`: Derivative of the tank 1 water level
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank 1 (parameter)
