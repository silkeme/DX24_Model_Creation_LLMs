Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

1. Pump equation:
```python
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve flow equations:
```python
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

3. Tank level equation:
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

4. Assuming the tank is open and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, the pressure at the tank outlet is atmospheric, and the flow through the valve is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop across the valve.

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_level',
    'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed (control variable)
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0 (control variable)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0 (parameter)
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1 (control variable)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1 (parameter)
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1 (variable)
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1 (variable)

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, the actual values of the parameters, and the control strategy for the pump and valves.
