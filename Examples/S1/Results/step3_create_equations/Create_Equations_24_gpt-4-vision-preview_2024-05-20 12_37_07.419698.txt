Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

```python
# Equations for the pump
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V  # Flow rate through the pump

# Equations for valve0
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal  # Flow rate through valve0

# Equations for tank1
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)  # Rate of change of water level in tank1

# Equations for valve1
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal  # Flow rate through valve1

# Assuming valve1_V_flow is the flow rate through valve1
valve1_V_flow = valve1_flow

# Assuming pump_N is the control variable for the pump speed
pump_N = pump_N

# Assuming valve0_opening and valve1_opening are the control variables for the valve openings
valve0_opening = valve0_opening
valve1_opening = valve1_opening

# List of all variables in the equations
variables = [
    pump_flow, valve0_flow, der_tank1_level, valve1_flow, valve1_V_flow,
    pump_N, valve0_opening, valve1_opening,
    der_pump_medium_T, der_pump_medium_p, der_tank1_level, der_tank1_medium_T,
    der_pump_U, der_pump_m, der_pump_medium_u, der_pump_rho,
    der_tank1_U, der_tank1_V, der_tank1_heatTransfer_states_1__d, der_tank1_m, der_tank1_medium_u, der_tank1_ports_1__h_outflow

This model assumes that the flow through the pump is directly proportional to the pump speed and the pump's volume per revolution. The flow through each valve is assumed to be proportional to the valve opening and its nominal flow rate. The rate of change of the water level in the tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The system is assumed to be adiabatic, with no energy losses, and the fluid is incompressible water.
