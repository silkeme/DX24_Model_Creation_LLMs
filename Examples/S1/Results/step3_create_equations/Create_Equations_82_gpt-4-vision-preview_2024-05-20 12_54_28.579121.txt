Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (œÅ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q) through the valve:
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation, derived from mass balance on the tank:
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_Q', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_Q',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Q', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Volume per pump revolution
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate of the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of the water level in tank1

This model assumes that the pump speed is directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate, and the valve openings are linearly related to their respective flow rates. The tank level changes based on the difference between the inflow and outflow volumetric flow rates.
