Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)

# Tank outflow equation
tank1_ports_2__m_flow = valve1_V_flow
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_ports_2__m_flow'
]
```

Symbols used:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `pump_V_flow`: Pump volume flow rate
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening control variable
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_V_flow`: Valve0 volume flow rate
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening control variable
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_V_flow`: Valve1 volume flow rate
- `tank1_level`: Level of water in tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `tank1_ports_2__m_flow`: Mass flow rate out of tank1 through valve1

Note: The equations assume that the pump speed (`pump_N`) and valve openings (`valve0_opening`, `valve1_opening`) are control variables that can be adjusted to control the flow rates. The pressure drops across the valves (`valve0_dp`, `valve1_dp`) would need to be calculated based on the system's dynamics, which are not provided here. The tank level (`tank1_level`) is a state variable that changes over time based on the difference between the inflow and outflow rates.
