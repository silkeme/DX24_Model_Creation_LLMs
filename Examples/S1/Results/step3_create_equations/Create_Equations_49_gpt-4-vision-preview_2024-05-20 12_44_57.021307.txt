Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the pumps and valves, and a mass balance for the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow in minus the mass flow out.

```python
# Tank mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 
    'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level', 'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal pump speed
- `pump_V`: Pump volume flow rate
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank1
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1

Please note that the equations provided are simplified and based on the assumptions given. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as pump and valve characteristics, friction losses, and non-adiabatic conditions would need to be considered.
