Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable, parameter, and control variable names to construct the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank:

1. Pump equation:
The pump's volumetric flow rate can be related to the pump speed (N) and the pump's volumetric efficiency (V). Since no specific efficiency is given, we will assume it is a function of the pump speed and other factors.

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations:
The flow through a valve can be modeled as a function of the valve opening and the pressure drop across the valve. Since we are assuming no energy losses and an adiabatic process, we can simplify the valve flow equations.

```python
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation:
The rate of change of the tank level is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank. The cross-sectional area can be calculated from the tank diameter.

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / tank1_Area
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal',
    'valve0_V_flow', 'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_Area', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `time`: Simulation time variable.
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable.
- `pump_V`: Pump volumetric efficiency parameter.
- `pump_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump.
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for valve0 opening.
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate parameter for valve0.
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0.
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for valve1 opening.
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate parameter for valve1.
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1.
- `tank1_Diameter`: Parameter for the diameter of tank1.
- `tank1_Area`: Cross-sectional area of tank1.
- `tank1_level`: Variable for the water level in tank1.
- `der_tank1_level`: Derivative of the tank1 water level with respect to time.

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information about the system, such as the pump's volumetric efficiency as a function of speed and other factors, which are not provided here. The equations above are simplified and based on the assumptions given.
