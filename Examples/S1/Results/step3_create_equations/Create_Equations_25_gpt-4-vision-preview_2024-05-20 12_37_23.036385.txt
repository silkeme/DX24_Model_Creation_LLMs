Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank, which relates the inflow, outflow, and the change in water level:

```python
# Tank mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level',
    'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow', 'pump_flow'
]
```

This list includes the variables for the pump speed (`pump_N`), nominal pump speed (`pump_N_Nominal`), pump volume flow rate (`pump_V`), valve openings (`valve0_opening`, `valve1_opening`), nominal flow rates for the valves (`valve0_Flow_Nominal`, `valve1_Flow_Nominal`), pressure drops across the valves (`valve0_dp`, `valve1_dp`), nominal pressure drops for the valves (`valve0_dp_nominal`, `valve1_dp_nominal`), tank diameter (`tank1_Diameter`), derivative of the tank water level (`der_tank1_level`), and the calculated flows through the valve and pump (`valve0_flow`, `valve1_flow`, `pump_flow`).

Please note that the equations provided are simplified and assume ideal conditions based on the assumptions given. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as friction losses, pump efficiency, and non-ideal valve characteristics would need to be considered.
