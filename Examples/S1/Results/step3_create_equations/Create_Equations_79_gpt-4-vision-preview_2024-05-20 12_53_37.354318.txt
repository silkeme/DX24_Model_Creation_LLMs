Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow_rate = pump_N * pump_V  # Flow rate is proportional to pump speed and pump volume

# Valve equations
valve0_flow_rate = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal  # Flow rate is proportional to valve opening and nominal flow
valve1_flow_rate = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank equation using mass balance
# The rate of change of the tank's water level is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates divided by the tank's cross-sectional area
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow_rate - valve1_flow_rate) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_flow_rate',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_flow_rate',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_flow_rate',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the control variables for the pump and valves, the flow rates through the pump and valves, and the derivative of the tank1 water level. The variable `der_tank1_level` represents the rate of change of the water level in tank1, which is a key part of the dynamical model.

Symbols used:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Volume per revolution of the pump
- `pump_flow_rate`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for the opening of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_flow_rate`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for the opening of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_flow_rate`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Derivative of the water level in tank1

This model assumes that the flow rates through the pump and valves can be directly controlled or measured, which is a simplification. In a more detailed model, you would need to account for the dynamics of the pump and valves, as well as possible nonlinearities and pressure losses.
