Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the valve openings, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in `tank1` will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves can be derived from the assumption that the fluid is incompressible and there are no energy losses. The flow through the pump is proportional to its speed, and the flow through the valves is proportional to their openings and the square root of the pressure difference across them (which we will assume to be a function of the level in the tank for `valve0` and a constant for `valve1` since it's connected to the outlet).

Here are the equations:

```python
# Pump flow equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * (tank1_level * valve0_dp_nominal)**0.5
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_dp_nominal**0.5

# Tank level equation (continuity equation)
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed (control variable)
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `pump_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0 (control variable)
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure difference across valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1 (control variable)
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure difference across valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1 (variable)
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `der_tank1_level`: Time derivative of the water level in tank1 (variable)
