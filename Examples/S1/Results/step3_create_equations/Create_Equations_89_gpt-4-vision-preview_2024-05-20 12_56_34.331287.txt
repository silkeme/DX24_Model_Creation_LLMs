Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the flow nominal parameters and control variables for the opening of the valves:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

Next, we'll define the equation for the tank level based on the inflow and outflow:

```python
# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.14159265359 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's define the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal pump speed
- `pump_V`: Pump volume
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank1

Please note that the equations provided are simplified and based on the assumptions given. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as pump efficiency, valve characteristics, and tank geometry would need to be considered.
