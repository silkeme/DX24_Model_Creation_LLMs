Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

Next, we'll set up the mass balance for Tank1. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow rate in minus the mass flow rate out. Since the fluid is incompressible, we can use volume flow rates instead of mass flow rates:

```python
# Tank1 mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 
    'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 
    'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level', 
    'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow', 'pump_flow'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Current speed of the pump
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pump
- `pump_V`: Volume flow rate of the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of the water level in tank1
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump

This model assumes that the pump speed and valve openings are directly controlling the flow rates, which is a simplification. In a more detailed model, you would include the dynamics of the pump and the characteristics of the valves, as well as consider the fluid properties and the system's response to changes in these control variables.
