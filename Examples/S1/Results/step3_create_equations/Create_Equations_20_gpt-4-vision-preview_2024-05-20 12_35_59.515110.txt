Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (ρ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q) and the pressure drop (Δp) across the valve:
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation, derived from mass balance (rate of change of mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow rate in minus the mass flow rate out):
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening',
    'pump_Q', 'valve0_Q', 'valve1_Q', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `time`: Time variable
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening control variable
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening control variable
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter)

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the pump characteristic curve, valve characteristic curves, and the actual geometry of the tank to accurately model the system. The equations provided are simplified and based on the assumptions given.
