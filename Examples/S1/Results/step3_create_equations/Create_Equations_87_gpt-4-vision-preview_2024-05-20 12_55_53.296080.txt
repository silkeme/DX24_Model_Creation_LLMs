Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tank level changes based on the difference between inflow and outflow.

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Control variable for pump speed
- `pump_V`: Parameter for pump volume per revolution
- `pump_V_flow`: Variable for volume flow rate of the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for valve0 opening
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Parameter for nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_V_flow`: Variable for volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for valve1 opening
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Parameter for nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_V_flow`: Variable for volume flow rate through valve1
- `der_tank1_level`: Variable for the rate of change of water level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Parameter for the diameter of tank1

This model assumes that the pump speed and valve openings are directly controlling the flow rates, and that the tank level changes based on the net flow rate into and out of the tank. The model is simplified and does not account for detailed fluid dynamics or thermodynamics beyond the basic conservation of mass.
