Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the valve openings, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in tank1 will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves, assuming a linear relationship between the control variables and the flow rates, and using the nominal flow parameters, could be:

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

For the tank, we can use the principle of conservation of mass to relate the inflow and outflow to the rate of change of the tank level:

```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations above. The `der_tank1_level` variable represents the derivative of the tank1 level with respect to time, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank.

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed (control variable)
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal pump speed (parameter)
- `pump_V`: Volume flow coefficient for the pump (parameter)
- `pump_V_flow`: Volume flow through the pump (variable)
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening fraction (control variable)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volume flow through valve0 (variable)
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening fraction (control variable)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow through valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volume flow through valve1 (variable)
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1 (variable)
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1 (variable)
