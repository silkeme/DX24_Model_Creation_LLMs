Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow in minus the mass flow out.

```python
# Tank mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:

```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening',
    'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'tank1_Diameter',
    'pump_flow', 'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `time`: Simulation time variable.
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable.
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter).
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for the opening of valve0.
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for the opening of valve1.
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter).
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter).
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter).
- `pump_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump.
- `valve0_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0.
- `valve1_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1.
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of the water level in tank1.

This model assumes that the flow through the pump and valves can be directly controlled or is a function of their respective control variables and parameters. The tank level is calculated based on the difference between the inflow and outflow volumetric rates, assuming a cylindrical tank shape for the area calculation.
