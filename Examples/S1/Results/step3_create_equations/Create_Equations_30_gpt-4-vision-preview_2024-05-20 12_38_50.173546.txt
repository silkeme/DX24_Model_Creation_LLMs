Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable, parameter, and control variable names to construct the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank:

1. Pump equation:
The pump's volumetric flow rate can be related to the pump speed (N) and pump volume (V):
```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations:
The flow through a valve can be calculated using the valve opening and a nominal flow rate:
```python
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation:
The rate of change of the tank level is the difference between the inflow and outflow divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (A = Ï€ * (D/2)^2):
```python
A_tank1 = 3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / A_tank1
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:
```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow', 
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow', 
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow', 
    'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Volume per pump revolution
- `pump_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate of the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and numerical methods for solving the differential equations.
