Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the valve openings, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in `tank1` will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves, assuming a linear relationship between the control variables and the flow rates, and using the nominal flow parameters, could be:

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

For the tank, we can use the conservation of mass to relate the inflow, outflow, and the change in water level. Assuming the cross-sectional area `A` of the tank is constant and given by `A = (pi/4) * tank1_Diameter**2`, the rate of change of the water level in the tank can be described by:

```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / A
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations above. Note that we have not defined any symbols or executed any Python code; we have only written the equations and the list of variables as per the instructions.
