Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)

# Assuming the tank is open and the process is adiabatic, we can ignore the pressure and temperature equations for the tank.
```

Now, let's store all the variables in one list:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_medium_T, pump_medium_p, tank1_level, tank1_medium_T, der_pump_medium_T, der_pump_medium_p, 
    der_tank1_level, der_tank1_medium_T, der_pipe4_flowModel_states_1__h, der_pump_U, der_pump_m, 
    der_pump_medium_u, der_pump_rho, der_tank1_U, der_tank1_V, der_tank1_heatTransfer_states_1__d, 
    der_tank1_m, der_tank1_medium_u, der_tank1_ports_1__h_outflow, pump_flow, valve0_flow, valve1_flow
]

# Note: The list includes the variables from the equations we created and the ones provided that are relevant to the system.
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `der_tank1_level`: Derivative of the water level in tank1 with respect to time
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening fraction control variable
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening fraction control variable
- `pump_V`: Volume per revolution for the pump
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate for valve0
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate for valve1
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1

The other variables in the list are from the provided variable names, which are not directly used in the equations but are part of the system's state and may be used in further development of the model.
