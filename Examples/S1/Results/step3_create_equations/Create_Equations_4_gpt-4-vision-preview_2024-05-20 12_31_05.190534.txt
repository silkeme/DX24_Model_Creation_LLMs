Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (ρ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation, derived from mass balance (rate of change of mass is equal to the mass flow rate in minus mass flow rate out):
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening',
    'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'tank1_Diameter',
    'pump_Q', 'valve0_Q', 'valve1_Q', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `time`: Simulation time variable.
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable.
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter).
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for valve0 opening.
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for valve1 opening.
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate for valve0 (parameter).
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate for valve1 (parameter).
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter).
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump.
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0.
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1.
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1.

Please note that this is a simplified model and does not account for various real-world factors such as pump and valve characteristics, pipe losses, or changes in water density with temperature.
