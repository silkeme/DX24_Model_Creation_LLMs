Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the flow through the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

Next, we'll set up the mass balance for tank1. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is the difference between the inflow and outflow:

```python
der_tank1_m = valve0_flow - valve1_flow
```

Since the fluid is incompressible, the volume flow is equal to the mass flow divided by the density of water (which we'll assume to be constant at a typical value of 1000 kg/m^3):

```python
der_tank1_V = der_tank1_m / 1000
```

The rate of change of the water level in the tank is the rate of change of the volume divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (assuming the tank has a constant cross-sectional area):

```python
tank1_cross_sectional_area = (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2 * 3.14159
der_tank1_level = der_tank1_V / tank1_cross_sectional_area
```

Now, let's collect all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_m',
    'der_tank1_V', 'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_cross_sectional_area'
]
```

This list of variables includes the time, control variables for the pump and valves, parameters for the valves, the diameter of the tank (used to calculate the cross-sectional area), and the derivatives of the mass, volume, and level of the tank.

Please note that this is a simplified model and does not take into account various real-world factors such as pump and valve characteristics beyond the nominal flow, the actual geometry of the tank, and potential energy losses.
