Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (ρ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q) instead of mass flow rates.

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q) through the valve:
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank equation, relating the inflow and outflow to the change in water level (h):
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (3.14159265359 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_Q',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_Q',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Q',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Volume per pump revolution
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate from the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1

Please note that the actual Python code would require the definition of the parameters and control variables, as well as the integration of the differential equation for the tank level over time. However, as per the instructions, we are only creating the equations and the list of variables at this stage.
