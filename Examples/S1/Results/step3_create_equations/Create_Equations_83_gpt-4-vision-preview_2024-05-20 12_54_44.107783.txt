Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (œÅ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation, derived from mass balance:
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_Q',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_Q',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Q',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening control variable
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate through valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening control variable
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate through valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `tank1_level`: Level of water in tank1 (variable)
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1 (derivative of `tank1_level`)

This model assumes that the pump speed directly controls the flow rate through the pump, and the valve openings control the flow rates through the valves. The tank level changes based on the difference between the inflow from valve0 and the outflow through valve1.
