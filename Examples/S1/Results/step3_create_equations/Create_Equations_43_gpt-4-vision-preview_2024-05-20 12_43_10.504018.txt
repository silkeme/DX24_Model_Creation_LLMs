Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tank level changes based on the difference between inflow and outflow.

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list as requested:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_medium_T, pump_medium_p, tank1_level, tank1_medium_T,
    der_pump_medium_T, der_pump_medium_p, der_tank1_level, der_tank1_medium_T,
    pump_U, pump_m, pump_medium_u, pump_rho, tank1_U, tank1_V,
    tank1_m, tank1_medium_u, pump_Hb_flow, pump_V_flow, pump_V_flow_single,
    pump_W_single, pump_Wb_flow, pump_dp_pump, pump_eta, pump_fluidVolume,
    pump_head, pump_heatTransfer_heatPorts_1__Q_flow, pump_m_flow_single,
    pump_mb_flow, pump_medium_MM, pump_medium_R, pump_medium_T_degC,
    pump_medium_X_1_, pump_medium_p_bar, pump_medium_sat_Tsat, pump_monitoring_state_in_T,
    pump_monitoring_state_in_d, pump_s, pump0_simulator_real, tank1_Hb_flow,
    tank1_Wb_flow, tank1_heatTransfer_heatPorts_1__Q_flow, tank1_mb_flow,
    tank1_medium_MM, tank1_medium_R, tank1_medium_T_degC, tank1_medium_X_1_,
    tank1_medium_p_bar, tank1_medium_sat_Tsat, tank1_ports_1__h_outflow,
    tank1_ports_2__m_flow, tank1_ports_1__p, tank1_ports_2__p, tank1_ports_E_flow_1_,
    tank1_ports_E_flow_2_, tank1_ports_E_flow_3_, tank1_ports_H_flow_1_,
    tank1_ports_H_flow_2_, tank1_ports_H_flow_3_, tank1_ports_penetration_1_,
    tank1_ports_penetration_2_, tank1_ports_penetration_3_, tank1_s_1_,
    tank1_s_2_, tank1_s_3_, tank1_vessel_ps_static_1_, tank1_vessel_ps_static_2_,
    tank1_vessel_ps_static_3_, valve0_V_flow, valve0_dp, valve0_port_a_T,
    valve0_port_b_T, valve0_simulator_real, valve1_V_flow, valve1_dp,
    valve1_port_a_T, valve1_port_b_T, valve1_simulator_real, pump_N, valve0_opening,
    valve1_opening
]
```

Please note that the above code is not executable as is, because the variables are not defined as symbols. This is just a representation of the equations and the list of variables as requested. The actual implementation would require defining these variables and parameters appropriately in the context of a simulation environment like OpenModelica.
