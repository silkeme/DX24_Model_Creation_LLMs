Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (ρ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q) and the pressure drop (Δp):
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * sqrt(valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

3. Tank equation, relating the inflow and outflow to the change in water level (h):
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (pi * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    pump_Q, pump_N, pump_V, valve0_Q, valve0_opening, valve0_Flow_Nominal, valve0_dp, valve0_dp_nominal,
    valve1_Q, valve1_opening, valve1_Flow_Nominal, valve1_dp, valve1_dp_nominal, der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Volume per revolution of the pump
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through Valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of Valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of Valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across Valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across Valve0
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through Valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of Valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of Valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across Valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across Valve1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in Tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of Tank1

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the pump characteristics, valve characteristics, and initial conditions for the tank level. The equations provided are simplified and assume linear characteristics for the valves, which may not be accurate in a real system.
