Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tank level changes based on the difference between inflow and outflow.

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level dynamics
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the variables for the pump speed, pump volume flow, valve openings, valve nominal flows, tank diameter, tank level, and the derivative of the tank level. The derivative of the tank level (`der_tank1_level`) represents the rate of change of the water level in the tank, which is a function of the inflow from valve0 and the outflow through valve1.

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional considerations such as the physical properties of the fluid, the characteristics of the pump and valves, and the initial conditions of the system. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we have created a simplified model using the provided variable names and parameters.
