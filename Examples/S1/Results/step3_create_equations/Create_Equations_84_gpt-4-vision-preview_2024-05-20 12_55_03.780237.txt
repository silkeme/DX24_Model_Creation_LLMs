Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

1. Pump equation:
```python
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve flow equations:
```python
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

3. Tank level equation:
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

4. Continuity for the pump and valve pressures:
```python
valve0_dp = pump_dp_pump
valve1_dp = tank1_ports_1__p - tank1_ports_2__p
```

5. Assuming the tank is open and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, the pressure at the tank's output is atmospheric, so:
```python
tank1_ports_2__p = 0
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_N, pump_V, valve0_opening, valve0_Flow_Nominal, valve0_dp, valve0_dp_nominal,
    valve1_opening, valve1_Flow_Nominal, valve1_dp, valve1_dp_nominal, tank1_Diameter,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_ports_1__p, tank1_ports_2__p, pump_dp_pump
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed (control variable)
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0 (control variable)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0 (parameter)
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1 (control variable)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1 (parameter)
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `tank1_ports_1__p`: Pressure at the inlet of tank1
- `tank1_ports_2__p`: Pressure at the outlet of tank1
- `pump_dp_pump`: Pressure increase across the pump

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, the properties of water, and the integration method for the differential equation.
