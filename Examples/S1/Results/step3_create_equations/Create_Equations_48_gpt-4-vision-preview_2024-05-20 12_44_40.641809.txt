Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create the following equations for the model:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)

# Assuming the density of water is constant (incompressible fluid)
tank1_ports_2__m_flow = valve0_V_flow * 1000  # Convert from m^3/s to kg/s
valve1_m_flow = valve1_V_flow * 1000  # Convert from m^3/s to kg/s

# Assuming adiabatic process, no energy losses, and open tanks
# No additional equations for temperature or pressure are needed
```

Now, we will create a list of all the variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_V_flow, pump_N, pump_V,
    valve0_V_flow, valve0_opening, valve0_Flow_Nominal, valve0_dp, valve0_dp_nominal,
    valve1_V_flow, valve1_opening, valve1_Flow_Nominal, valve1_dp, valve1_dp_nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter,
    tank1_ports_2__m_flow, valve1_m_flow
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed (control variable)
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0 (control variable)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0 (parameter)
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0 (parameter)
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1 (control variable)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1 (parameter)
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1 (parameter)
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1 (parameter)
- `tank1_ports_2__m_flow`: Mass flow rate out of valve0 into tank1
- `valve1_m_flow`: Mass flow rate out of tank1 through valve1

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, the actual values for the parameters, and the control variables. The equations provided are based on the assumptions given and the typical form of the equations for such systems.
