Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the flow nominal parameters and control variables for the opening of the valves:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

Next, we'll define the equation for the tank level based on the inflow and outflow:

```python
# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level',
    'pump_flow', 'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal pump speed parameter
- `pump_V`: Pump volume parameter
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for valve0 opening
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow parameter for valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop parameter for valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for valve1 opening
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow parameter for valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop parameter for valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter parameter for tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Derivative of tank1 water level with respect to time
- `pump_flow`: Calculated flow rate from the pump
- `valve0_flow`: Calculated flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_flow`: Calculated flow rate through valve1

Please note that the equations provided are simplified and based on the assumptions given. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as pump efficiency, valve characteristics, and tank geometry would need to be considered.
