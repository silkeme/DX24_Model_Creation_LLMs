Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable, parameter, and control variable names to construct the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank:

1. Pump equation:
The pump's flow rate can be modeled as a function of the pump speed (N) and the pump's volumetric efficiency (V). Since no specific pump model is provided, we'll assume a linear relationship between the pump speed and the flow rate.

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations:
The flow through a valve can be modeled as a function of the valve opening and the nominal flow rate at a given pressure drop. Since the process is adiabatic and there are no energy losses, we'll assume the nominal flow rate is achieved at the nominal pressure drop.

```python
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Tank level equation:
The rate of change of the tank level can be modeled using the inflow and outflow rates and the cross-sectional area of the tank. The cross-sectional area can be calculated from the tank diameter.

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / tank1_Area
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_V_flow', 'pump_N', 'pump_V',
    'valve0_V_flow', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal',
    'valve1_V_flow', 'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal',
    'tank1_Area', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level',
    'tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Pump volumetric efficiency
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate through valve0 at nominal pressure drop
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate through valve1 at nominal pressure drop
- `tank1_Area`: Cross-sectional area of tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of the water level in tank1
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1

Please note that the actual implementation may require additional parameters and more complex equations to accurately model the system dynamics, including pump characteristics, valve characteristics, and tank geometry.
