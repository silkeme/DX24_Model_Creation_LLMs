Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the valve openings, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in tank1 will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves can be derived from the assumption that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings. The equation for the tank level will be derived from the conservation of mass.

Here are the equations:

```python
# Pump flow equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, we will store all the variables used in the equations in a list:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```
