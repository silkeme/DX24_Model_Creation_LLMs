Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the given variable names and parameters to define the equations for the volume flow through the valves and pumps and the fluid level in the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the pump speed and valve openings, and that the tank level changes based on the difference between inflow and outflow.

```python
# Pump equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_N_Nominal

# Valve equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    pump_V_flow, pump_N, pump_N_Nominal,
    valve0_V_flow, valve0_opening, valve0_Flow_Nominal,
    valve1_V_flow, valve1_opening, valve1_Flow_Nominal,
    der_tank1_level, tank1_Diameter
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal pump speed parameter
- `valve0_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve0_opening`: Control variable for valve0 opening
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate parameter for valve0
- `valve1_V_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1
- `valve1_opening`: Control variable for valve1 opening
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate parameter for valve1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of fluid level in tank1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Parameter for the diameter of tank1

Please note that the equations provided are simplified and based on the assumptions given. In a real-world scenario, additional factors such as pump and valve characteristics, friction losses, and non-adiabatic conditions would need to be considered.
