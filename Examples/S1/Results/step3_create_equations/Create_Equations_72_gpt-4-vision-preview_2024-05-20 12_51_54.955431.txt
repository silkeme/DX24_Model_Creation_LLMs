Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (œÅ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Mass balance for tank1, relating the inflow and outflow to the rate of change of the tank level (h):
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening',
    'pump_Q', 'valve0_Q', 'valve1_Q', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `time`: Time variable
- `pump_N`: Pump speed control variable
- `pump_V`: Pump volume per revolution (parameter)
- `valve0_opening`: Valve0 opening control variable
- `valve1_opening`: Valve1 opening control variable
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_level`: Water level in tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the pump characteristic curve, valve characteristics, and the initial conditions for the tank level. The equations provided are simplified and assume linear relationships for the pump and valves, which may not be accurate in a real system.
