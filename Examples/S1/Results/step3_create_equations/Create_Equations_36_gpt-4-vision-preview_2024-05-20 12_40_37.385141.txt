Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the pumps and valves, and a mass balance for the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves, assuming that the flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference across the device and the opening of the valves:

```python
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (pump_dp_pump / valve0_dp_nominal)**0.5
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (tank1_ports_1__p / valve1_dp_nominal)**0.5
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow rate in minus the mass flow rate out:

```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_medium_T, pump_medium_p, tank1_level, tank1_medium_T, der_pump_medium_T, 
    der_pump_medium_p, der_tank1_level, der_tank1_medium_T, der_pipe4_flowModel_states_1__h, 
    der_pump_U, der_pump_m, der_pump_medium_u, der_pump_rho, der_tank1_U, der_tank1_V, 
    der_tank1_heatTransfer_states_1__d, der_tank1_m, der_tank1_medium_u, der_tank1_ports_1__h_outflow, 
    pump_flow, valve0_flow, valve1_flow
]
```

Please note that the above equations and variables are based on the provided names and assumptions. The actual implementation may require additional considerations such as the specific characteristics of the pump and valves, the geometry of the tank, and the properties of the fluid.
