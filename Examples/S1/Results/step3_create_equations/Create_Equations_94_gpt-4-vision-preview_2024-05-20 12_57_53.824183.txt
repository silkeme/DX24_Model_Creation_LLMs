Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V

# Valve0 flow equation
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5

# Valve1 flow equation
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)**2)**0.5
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for Tank1. The rate of change of the water level in the tank is proportional to the difference between the inflow and outflow:

```python
# Tank1 mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2)**2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level',
    'pump_flow', 'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Current speed of the pump
- `pump_N_Nominal`: Nominal speed of the pump
- `pump_V`: Volume flow rate of the pump at nominal speed
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0 (0-1)
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_dp`: Pressure drop across valve0
- `valve0_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1 (0-1)
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_dp`: Pressure drop across valve1
- `valve1_dp_nominal`: Nominal pressure drop across valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of Tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in Tank1
- `pump_flow`: Volume flow rate through the pump
- `valve0_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_flow`: Volume flow rate through valve1

This model assumes that the pressure drop across the valves can be controlled or measured to calculate the flow rates, and that the pump speed can be controlled. The tank level is calculated based on the difference between the inflow and outflow rates.
