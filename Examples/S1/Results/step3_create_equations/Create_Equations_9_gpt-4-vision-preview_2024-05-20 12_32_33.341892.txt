Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the valve openings, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in `tank1` will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves, assuming a linear relationship between the control variables and the flow rates, and using the nominal flow parameters, could be:

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

For the tank, we can use the principle of conservation of mass to relate the inflow and outflow to the change in water level. The rate of change of the water level in the tank can be described by the differential equation:

```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations above. The `der_tank1_level` variable represents the derivative of the `tank1_level` with respect to time, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank. The `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow` variables represent the volume flow rates through the pump and valves, respectively. The `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` are the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings. The `pump_N_Nominal`, `valve0_Flow_Nominal`, and `valve1_Flow_Nominal` are parameters representing the nominal values for the pump speed and valve flows. The `tank1_Diameter` is a parameter representing the diameter of the tank, which is used to calculate the cross-sectional area for the level calculation.
