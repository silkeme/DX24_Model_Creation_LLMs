Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the control variables `pump_N`, `valve0_opening`, and `valve1_opening` to represent the pump speed and the openings of the valves, respectively. The volume flow through the pump and valves will be represented by `pump_V_flow`, `valve0_V_flow`, and `valve1_V_flow`. The level of water in `tank1` will be represented by `tank1_level`.

The equations for the pump and valves can be derived from the assumption that the fluid is incompressible and there are no energy losses. The flow through the pump is proportional to its speed, and the flow through the valves is proportional to their openings and the pressure drop across them, which we will assume to be nominal since there are no losses.

The equation for the tank level will be based on the conservation of mass, where the rate of change of the tank's volume is equal to the inflow minus the outflow.

Here are the equations:

```python
# Pump flow equation
pump_V_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal

# Tank level equation
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_V_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'tank1_level', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the variables directly used in the equations above. The `der_tank1_level` represents the derivative of the `tank1_level` with respect to time, which is the rate of change of the water level in the tank. The `pump_V` is a parameter representing the volumetric flow coefficient of the pump, which relates the pump speed to the flow rate. The `tank1_Diameter` is a parameter representing the diameter of the tank, which is used to calculate the cross-sectional area for the level equation. The `valve0_Flow_Nominal` and `valve1_Flow_Nominal` are parameters representing the nominal flow rates of the valves when fully open.
