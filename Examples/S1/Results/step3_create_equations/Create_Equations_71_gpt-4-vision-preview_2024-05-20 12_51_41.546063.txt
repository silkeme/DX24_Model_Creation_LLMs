Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow to model the pumps and valves, and a mass balance for the tank.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve flow equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank. The rate of change of the mass in the tank is equal to the mass flow rate in minus the mass flow rate out.

```python
# Mass balance for tank1
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (tank1_Diameter**2 * 3.14159 / 4)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list as requested:

```python
variables = [
    time, pump_medium_T, pump_medium_p, tank1_level, tank1_medium_T,
    der_pump_medium_T, der_pump_medium_p, der_tank1_level, der_tank1_medium_T,
    der_pipe4_flowModel_states_1__h, der_pump_U, der_pump_m, der_pump_medium_u,
    der_pump_rho, der_tank1_U, der_tank1_V, der_tank1_heatTransfer_states_1__d,
    der_tank1_m, der_tank1_medium_u, der_tank1_ports_1__h_outflow, pump_flow,
    valve0_flow, valve1_flow
]
```

Please note that the above code is not executable as is. It is a representation of the equations and variables that would be used in a dynamical model for the given system. The actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, the physical properties of water, and the numerical methods for solving the differential equations.
