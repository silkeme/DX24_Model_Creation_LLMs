Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and the process is adiabatic with no energy losses, we can simplify the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump and valves using the Bernoulli equation and the control variables for the pump speed and valve openings:

```python
# Pump equation
pump_flow = pump_N * pump_V

# Valve equations
valve0_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

Next, we'll define the mass balance for the tank, which relates the inflow, outflow, and the change in water level:

```python
# Tank mass balance
der_tank1_level = (valve0_flow - valve1_flow) / (3.14159 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve0_flow',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_dp', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'valve1_flow',
    'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

This list includes the control variables for the pump and valves, the nominal flow and pressure drop parameters for the valves, the diameter of the tank, and the derivative of the tank level.

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the initial conditions, the physical properties of water, and the specific characteristics of the pump and valves. The equations provided are simplified and assume linear relationships between valve openings and flow rates, which may not be accurate in real-world scenarios.
