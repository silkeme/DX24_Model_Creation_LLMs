Based on the provided information and the image of the system, we can create a simple dynamical model for the fluid flow and tank level. We will use the given variable, parameter, and control variable names to construct the equations.

First, let's define the equations for the pump, valves, and tank:

1. Pump equation:
The pump's volumetric flow rate (pump_V_flow) can be related to the pump speed (pump_N) and a proportionality constant (pump_N_Nominal) which represents the nominal flow rate at nominal speed.

```python
pump_V_flow = pump_N / pump_N_Nominal * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations:
The volumetric flow rate through a valve (valve0_V_flow and valve1_V_flow) can be related to the valve opening (valve0_opening and valve1_opening), the nominal flow rate (valve0_Flow_Nominal and valve1_Flow_Nominal), and the pressure drop across the valve (valve0_dp and valve1_dp), which we will assume to be proportional to the nominal pressure drop (valve0_dp_nominal and valve1_dp_nominal) at the nominal flow rate.

```python
valve0_V_flow = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal)
valve1_V_flow = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal)
```

3. Tank level equation:
The rate of change of the tank level (der_tank1_level) is the difference between the inflow rate (valve0_V_flow) and the outflow rate (valve1_V_flow) divided by the cross-sectional area of the tank (tank1_Area), which can be calculated from the tank diameter (tank1_Diameter).

```python
tank1_Area = (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2 * 3.14159
der_tank1_level = (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow) / tank1_Area
```

Now, let's create the list of variables used in the equations:

```python
variables = [
    'time', 'pump_V_flow', 'pump_N', 'valve0_V_flow', 'valve1_V_flow',
    'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening', 'valve0_dp', 'valve1_dp',
    'tank1_level', 'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_Area', 'tank1_Diameter',
    'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp_nominal',
    'valve1_dp_nominal', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'pump_V'
]
```

Please note that the actual values for the parameters like `pump_V`, `pump_N_Nominal`, `valve0_Flow_Nominal`, `valve1_Flow_Nominal`, `valve0_dp_nominal`, `valve1_dp_nominal`, and `tank1_Diameter` need to be provided to complete the model. The equations provided are based on the assumptions given and the typical relationships for pumps and valves in fluid dynamics.
