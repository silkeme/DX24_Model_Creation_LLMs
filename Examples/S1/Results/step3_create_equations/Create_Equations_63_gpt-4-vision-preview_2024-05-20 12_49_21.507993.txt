Based on the provided information and the assumptions, we can create a simple dynamical model for the system. We will use the Bernoulli equation for the pump and valves, and a mass balance for the tank. Since the fluid is water and incompressible, we can assume constant density (ρ) and use volumetric flow rates (Q).

Let's define the equations:

1. Pump equation, relating the pump speed (N) to the volumetric flow rate (Q):
```python
pump_Q = pump_N * pump_V
```

2. Valve equations, relating the valve opening to the volumetric flow rate (Q) through the valve:
```python
valve0_Q = valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal
valve1_Q = valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal
```

3. Mass balance for Tank1, relating the change in water level to the inflow and outflow rates:
```python
der_tank1_level = (valve0_Q - valve1_Q) / (3.141592653589793 * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2)
```

Now, let's store all the variables in a list:
```python
variables = [
    'pump_N', 'pump_V', 'pump_Q', 'valve0_opening', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_Q',
    'valve1_opening', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Q', 'tank1_Diameter', 'der_tank1_level'
]
```

Brief description of the used symbols:
- `pump_N`: Pump speed
- `pump_V`: Volume per pump revolution
- `pump_Q`: Volumetric flow rate of the pump
- `valve0_opening`: Opening fraction of valve0
- `valve0_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve0
- `valve0_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve0
- `valve1_opening`: Opening fraction of valve1
- `valve1_Flow_Nominal`: Nominal flow rate of valve1
- `valve1_Q`: Volumetric flow rate through valve1
- `tank1_Diameter`: Diameter of tank1
- `der_tank1_level`: Rate of change of water level in tank1

Please note that the actual implementation would require additional information such as the pump characteristic curve, valve characteristic curves, and the initial conditions for the tank level. The equations provided are simplified and assume linear relationships for the pump and valves, which may not be accurate in a real system.
