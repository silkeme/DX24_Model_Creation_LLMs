To convert the given model into the required format for use with the faultdiagnosis toolbox, we need to define the equations in terms of symbolic variables and store them in the `model_def['rels']` list. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import sympy as sym
import faultdiagnosistoolbox as fdt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model_def = {
    'type': 'Symbolic',
    'x': ['pump_flow', 'valve0_flow', 'valve1_flow', 'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_level', 'valve0_dp', 'valve1_dp'],
    'f': ['f_tank1leak', 'f_valve0', 'f_valve1', 'f_pumpSlow'],
    'z': ['FI1', 'FI2', 'LI3', 'FI4', 'pump_N', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening'],
    'parameters': ['pump_V', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal', 'valve0_dp_nominal', 'valve1_dp_nominal', 'tank1_Diameter']
}

sym.var(model_def['x'])
sym.var(model_def['f'])
sym.var(model_def['z'])
sym.var(model_def['parameters'])

model_def['rels'] = [
    # Sensor equations
    -FI1 + pump_flow,
    -FI2 + valve0_flow,
    -LI3 + tank1_level,
    -FI4 + valve1_flow,
    
    # Pump equation with fault
    -pump_flow + pump_N * pump_V * (1 - f_pumpSlow),
    
    # Valve equations with faults
    -valve0_flow + valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve0_dp / valve0_dp_nominal) * (1 - f_valve0),
    -valve1_flow + valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - valve1_dp / valve1_dp_nominal) * (1 - f_valve1),
    
    # Tank mass balance with fault
    -der_tank1_level + (valve0_flow - valve1_flow - f_tank1leak) / (sym.pi * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2),
    fdt.DiffConstraint('der_tank1_level', 'tank1_level')
]

# Check if all variables in the equations occur in any of the lists 'x', 'f', 'z' or 'parameters'
# If they do not occur in any of the mentioned lists, add them under key 'x'
# In this case, all variables are already included in the lists
```

I've added the missing variables `tank1_level`, `valve0_dp`, and `valve1_dp` to the list of states 'x' since they are present in the equations but were not listed in the original 'x' list. Additionally, I've replaced the hardcoded value of `3.14159` with `sym.pi` for better precision and consistency with the symbolic toolbox.

The differential equation for `tank1_level` is represented using `fdt.DiffConstraint`, as required. All equations are stored in the `model_def['rels']` list, following the structure you provided.
