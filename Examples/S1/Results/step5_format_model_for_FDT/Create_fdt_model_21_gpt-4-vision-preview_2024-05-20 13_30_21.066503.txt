Based on the provided model and the image of the water tank system, we can convert the model into the required format for use with the faultdiagnosis toolbox. Here's how the model can be structured:

```python
import sympy as sym
import faultdiagnosistoolbox as fdt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model_def = {
    'type': 'Symbolic',
    'x': ['pump_V_flow', 'valve0_V_flow', 'valve1_V_flow', 'der_tank1_level', 'tank1_level'],
    'f': ['f_tank1leak', 'f_valve0', 'f_valve1', 'f_pumpSlow'],
    'z': ['FI1', 'FI2', 'LI3', 'FI4', 'pump_N', 'valve0_opening', 'valve1_opening'],
    'parameters': ['tank1_Diameter', 'pump_N_Nominal', 'valve0_Flow_Nominal', 'valve1_Flow_Nominal']
}

sym.var(model_def['x'])
sym.var(model_def['f'])
sym.var(model_def['z'])
sym.var(model_def['parameters'])

model_def['rels'] = [
    # Sensor equations
    -FI1 + pump_V_flow,
    -FI2 + valve0_V_flow,
    -LI3 + tank1_level,
    -FI4 + valve1_V_flow,
    
    # Pump equation with fault
    -pump_V_flow + pump_N * pump_N_Nominal * (1 - f_pumpSlow),
    
    # Valve equations with faults
    -valve0_V_flow + valve0_opening * valve0_Flow_Nominal * (1 - f_valve0),
    -valve1_V_flow + valve1_opening * valve1_Flow_Nominal * (1 - f_valve1),
    
    # Tank level equation with fault
    -der_tank1_level + (valve0_V_flow - valve1_V_flow - f_tank1leak) / (sym.pi * (tank1_Diameter / 2) ** 2),
    
    # Differential equation for tank level
    fdt.DiffConstraint('der_tank1_level', 'tank1_level')
]
```

I have added the `tank1_level` variable to the 'x' list since it is a state variable that was not included in the original 'x' list but is used in the equations. The equations have been stored in the `model_def['rels']` list as required, and the `fdt.DiffConstraint` has been used for the differential equation representing the rate of change of the tank level.

Please note that the `sym.pi` is used instead of the numerical value of pi to maintain symbolic consistency within the equations. The `sym.var` function is used to declare the variables as symbolic variables for the faultdiagnosis toolbox.
